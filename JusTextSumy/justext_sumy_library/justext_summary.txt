In the 1980s, traffic in downtown Boston was nearly unbearable from the tangled streets laid out centuries ago, so city planners and state transportation officials came up with what they considered a grand plan.When construction finished in 2007, the final price tag was around fifteen-billion dollars, about twice the original cost that was expected.It’s a tale as old as civil engineering: A megaproject is sold to the public as a grand solution to a serious problem.Work is delayed, expenses balloon, and when all the dust settles, it’s a lot less clear whether the project’s benefits were really worth the costs.Not many jobs go quite as awry as the Big Dig, but it’s not just megaprojects that suffer from our inability to accurately anticipate the expense and complexity of construction.And the people who have, those who are most qualified to do this job (the contractors that will actually bid on the project), usually aren’t allowed to participate in the cost estimating during design because it would spoil the fair and transparent procurement process.Large infrastructure projects are essentially huge collaborations between public and private organizations that span years, and sometimes decades, between planning, design, permitting, and construction.Prices vary widely across locations and types of goods, so the idea is that, if you monitor the dollar price of groceries, electricity, clothing, gasoline, et cetera, it can give you a broad measure of how the value of money changes over time for a normal consumer.Cost estimates have an expiration date, a concept that gets overlooked, sometimes even by owners, and often by the media who report these numbers.That slow time scale for construction projects creates another way that costs go up.There are still so many unanswered questions, the biggest one being, “How do we build this?” Large projects are complex, putting them at the mercy of all kinds of problems that can crop up during construction: material shortages, shipping delays, workforce issues, bad weather, and more.But you can’t saddle a contractor with all the risk that something unexpected won’t show up, and nearly all large contracts have change orders during construction that drive up the cost of the project.Of course, you can’t ignore the more nefarious ways that costs go up.You can’t set aside a billion dollars for a project that costs a hundred thousand, give or take a few K. Sure, you’ll come in under budget, but you just tied up a huge pile of public resources for no good reason.It turns out a lot of the research suggests spending more money during the planning and design phases.
