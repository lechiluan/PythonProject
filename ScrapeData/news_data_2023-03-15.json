            "\n\n",
            "\nStepping motors can be viewed as electric motors without commutators.\nTypically, all windings in the motor are part of the stator, and the\nrotor is either a permanent magnet or, in the case of variable reluctance\nmotors, a toothed block of some magnetically soft material.  All of the\ncommutation must be handled externally by the motor controller, and\ntypically, the motors and controllers are designed so that the motor may\nbe held in any fixed position as well as being rotated one way or the\nother.  Most steppers, as they are also known, can be stepped at audio\nfrequencies, allowing them to spin quite quickly, and with an appropriate\ncontroller, they may be started and stopped \"on a dime\" at controlled\norientations.\n",
            "\nFor some applications, there is a choice between using servomotors\nand stepping motors.  Both types of motors offer similar opportunities\nfor precise positioning, but they differ in a number of ways.  Servomotors\nrequire analog feedback control systems of some type.  Typically, this\ninvolves a potentiometer to provide feedback about the rotor position,\nand some mix of circuitry to drive a current through the motor inversely\nproportional to the difference between the desired position and the\ncurrent position.\n",
            "\nIn making a choice between steppers and servos, a number of\nissues must be considered; which of these will matter depends on the\napplication.  For example, the repeatability of positioning done with\na stepping motor depends on the geometry of the motor rotor, while the\nrepeatability of positioning done with a servomotor generally depends on\nthe stability of the potentiometer and other analog components in the\nfeedback circuit.\n",
            "\nStepping motors can be used in simple open-loop control systems; these\nare generally adequate for systems that operate at low accelerations with\nstatic loads, but closed loop control may be essential for high accelerations,\nparticularly if they involve variable loads.  If a stepper in an\nopen-loop control system is overtorqued, all knowledge of rotor position\nis lost and the system must be reinitialized; servomotors are not subject\nto this problem.\n",

            "\n    Questionable professional conduct can happen in any department, and IT is no exception. Follow these tips to cut down on the abuse of power which can sometimes occur in the technology field.  ",
            "As a huge Marvel film buff, I was always tickled by the comment made by Black Widow to Captain America in \u201cThe Avengers\u201d regarding Norse hero Thor and his adopted brother Loki: \u201cThese guys come from legend, Captain. They\u2019re basically gods.\u201d",
            "The quote appealed to me as an IT professional since we do seem to amass several god-like skills to do our work such as unlimited system/physical access, administrator rights, and the ability to bring about, or take away, things such as servers or software. It\u2019s humbling being an end user without these special powers, I can attest.",
            "Another Marvel quote comes from the Spiderman movies: \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d Sometimes great power gets misused irresponsibly in IT. Now, I have as much of a sense of humor as the next guy, and I understand that some funny business in the workplace can be a morale booster when it remains tasteful and appropriate (think memes or light-hearted joking).",
            "However, when the line gets crossed into irresponsible behavior, professionalism and productivity \u2013 not to mention trust \u2013 can be adversely impacted. Here are five examples of crossing the line and what management can \u2013 and should do \u2013 about it.",
            "Practical jokes using computers are probably the most popular IT shenanigan in the office. The internet is rife with tips on how to fool coworkers whose systems you hold power over. From changing their desktop wallpaper to something confusing or inappropriate, playing rude sounds on their speakers or otherwise sabotaging devices or systems, practical jokes can be a major impediment upon the target employee \u2013 particularly if the group they need to go to for help is the one causing them.",
            "Often said jokes are enacted using administrative credentials on the part of the offender to access the destination system. To curtail this sort of activity, you need policies and monitoring in place. TechRepublic\u2019s sister site, ",
            ", has an ",
            " which can define what systems are to be used for \u2013 and which can specify that inappropriate access for non-business purposes is an action subject to discipline.",
            "Of course, this means there has to be a way to know about this sort of activity, so a centralized logging and alerting solution like ",
            " can help achieve that. Often when another user accesses a Windows system there is a corresponding event in the local logs which can then be linked to an alert which notifies the appropriate personnel. The alert can be tailored so that it only goes out if the user logs into a system other than their own.",
            "What if said \u201cappropriate personnel\u201d receiving the alerts are the very same people pulling off the joke? If you\u2019re the boss, make sure the alert includes you (and/or security) and follow up on such alerts to determine the reason behind it. Sometimes just knowing said alert exists will deter negative behavior.",
            "IT personnel often have access to the entire office space in order to be able to diagnose or repair systems or provide entry to those who do. The same applies with having domain administrator/root access privileges. ",
            "This can turn into a nightmare if system administrators \u201cgo rogue\u201d and access confidential or personal information owned by others which is not relevant to their jobs. They might also log in with other accounts to impersonate users or cover their tracks (deleting event or system logs is another potential problem).",
            "Once again, event logging and alerting for both system and physical access (such as when the data center is entered) can help here, but if you\u2019re in charge of receiving and interpreting these alerts you may find yourself swamped, especially if administrators are merely doing their jobs by restoring a confidential file for finance, for example, and then opening it to confirm it has the right data.",
            "This is where a dedicated ticketing system to track all work requests can come in handy. If a ticket matches the file being restored in the previous example you know it was legitimate. If there\u2019s no corresponding ticket, however, an investigation may be in order.",
            "It can also be helpful to utilize standard policies in this scenario such as an ",
            " or ",
            " policy.",
            "The danger of social media is that it\u2019s always present and available and people use it consistently throughout the day or evening, which means inappropriate or confidential material related to the company might end up on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or any other public outlet.",
            "This might be something as relatively innocuous as posting a picture of drinking a beer in the office, or it might involve a post referring to company activities that shouldn\u2019t be publicly discussed, such as dealing with certain problem users and derogatorily referring to their behavior, making negative remarks about organizational rules or regulations or sharing details about company systems or security settings which could conceivably be used for malicious intentions.",
            "A ",
            " can define what actions employees should take in such situation and what topics or areas they should steer clear of.",
            "This one is not necessarily endemic to IT alone, but can happen across various fields. This refers to misrepresenting things which have occurred to exaggerate or revise history. ",
            "For example, it might involve claiming it took four hours to fix a server when in reality it took one hour and the other three were spent playing foosball. A new boss might be told that \u201cour old boss used to take us for happy hour drinks at the downstairs bar every Friday\u201d when no such habit existed. An employee might have a coworker badge in for him so the access will show he was present at work, when he\u2019s actually home sleeping. The list goes on.",
            "As the boss, you can\u2019t always detect every dishonest statement \u2013 I can say it would be very hard to dispute the four-hour versus one-hour server repair claim since no two repair jobs go the same way. But certainly you can reduce the risk of these tall tales with concepts such as an employee handbook (which might help verify whether the \u201chaving drinks on Friday\u201d story is legitimate) as well as policies involving badge usage, time tracking of work, attendance guidelines, and so forth.",
            "When you work in IT and can control who accesses what on the internet it\u2019s possible to turn slacking off into an art form. Whereas proxy servers might block the average user from getting out to the web to visit entertainment or gaming websites, any IT professional worth their salt could circumvent such blocks within moment.",
            "I\u2019ll be clear and state that a few moments of recreation on the job shouldn\u2019t be a problem so long as it doesn\u2019t involve too much time nor inappropriate material. Employees often need a bit of time to unwind and rediscover their focus, so long as their work duties are being fulfilled. ",
            "The problem here comes when IT professionals excuse themselves from the same restrictions applied to users. Fairness demands that such restrictions be implemented across the board.",
            "To combat this issue, regularly review proxy server/router configurations and logs, set up alerts if changes are made (where applicable) and implement an ",

            "Computer Science Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for students, researchers and practitioners of computer science. It only takes a minute to sign up.",
            "Q&A for work",
            "Connect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search.",
            "It looks like most of today's algorithm analysis is done in models with constant-time random access, such as the word RAM model. I don't know much about physics but from popular sources I've heard that there's supposed to be a limit on information storage per volume and on information travel speed, so RAMs don't seem to be physically realizable. Modern computers have all these cache levels which I'd say makes them not very RAM-like. So why should theoretical algorithms be set in RAM?",
            "Let me give a different take on it than vonbrand. Everything you said is true: the RAM model is not realistic for a number of reasons, and whereas it is possible to defend different aspects of it, such a defense doesn't really get to the heart of the matter.",
            " Compared to other models that are accepted, it more accurately models real-life computation. In particular, the reason we adopted the RAM model was primarily a response to Turing machines, as we found that the use of Turing machines leads to problems being artificially difficult to solve in terms of time complexity. The RAM model clearly solves this glaring issue, and thus it has been accepted, even though it remains far from perfect.",
            "A classical example that illustrates the glaring issue with Turing machines is the problem of string equality: given input",
            "where ",
            " are binary sequences and ",
            " is a separator, determining whether ",
            ". It can be shown that any Turing machine for the equality problem takes ",
            " time. This is uncomfortable, because Turing machines are what everyone thinks of as the universal model of computation -- yet no software engineer or algorithms researcher believes that string equality really takes ",
            " time. So what gives? String equality should be linear, so we invent a new model where it is, and the best solution available right now is word RAM machines.",
            "Perhaps some day in the future we will come up with a better model -- one that is simple, conceptually clear, and improves on RAM in its ability to model real-life computational complexity. For now, we can only make do with the best that we have.",
            "As a first, rough, approximation you can take the time to access a word in memory as constant, independent of preceding accesses. I.e., the RAM model.",
            "You are right, today's machines are quite un-RAM-like, it does pay off (even handsomely) to organize data access to be as sequential as possible or squeze the last bit of information out of a (short!) memory segment before manhandling the next. But you rarely have the leeway to do so, your memory accesses are essentially random and the model isn't that far from the truth. Plus today's machines have many more than one CPU, the model has just one. And then there is vector processing (doing the same operation on a vector of data, not one by one) as the \"multimedia instructions\" (and even more using graphics cards for processing) do.",
            "A bit of discussion is given for example by Khoung's ",
            ". As you see, analyzing even simple, well-understood algorithms under more realistic memory access time models is daunting.",
            "RAM model is motivated by asymptotic analysis of algorithms that are designed as single-threaded in-memory computations.",
            "Optimising performance for specific instruction set, caches and whatnot is one thing. The other thing is to be prepared for growth of the problem size. To estimate how well your in-memory algorithm scales you probably want to ignore small factors and focus on big ",
            " notation. Big ",
            " isn't going to optimise everything for you, but at least it may tell you that your solution scales well (or that you should try something different).",

            ". Note that this is a good model if we only care about asymptotic growth:",

In the ordinary course, bank runs don\u2019t last for a year; they either cause an institution to fail very quickly or peter out. But the other reason this is time-bounded is to defang the moral hazard, on behalf of both banks and their customers.

            "Last Tuesday, I posted a social media poll soliciting topics for the next article. Alongside some reasonable choices, I jokingly included \u201clife advice from an infosec has-been\u201d. This option ended up receiving the most votes \u2014 so despite some misgivings, I\u2019m going to hold up my end of the bargain.",
            "I landed my first infosec gig in the late 1990s. At the time, we didn\u2019t really have an industry to speak of. A handful of people worked here and there, but it wasn\u2019t a career choice your parents would approve of.",
            "It\u2019s been said we had it easier back then; I\u2019m not sure. We had less competition, but also far fewer opportunities to pursue. The community was pretty toxic, too: for example, we had militant \u201cantisec\u201d groups who doxxed, hacked, and harassed anyone who \u201csold out\u201d and took a corporate job.",
            "These crazy days might be over, but the field is still young. I think of it as a protoscience: a discipline with few immutable rules and plenty of breakthroughs yet to be made. Many of our best practitioners are self-taught, and it\u2019s important to stay self-driven and relentlessly curious. To this day, some of the best instincts come from experimentation, not books.",
            "When hiring, most tech companies still pay more attention to GitHub profiles and blogs than they do to certifications or academic degrees. With time, this will change: around 30% of occupations in the US require licensing, and that\u2019s true not just for doctors or architects, but for florists, hairdressers, and nail care pros. Our industry will not escape this fate \u2014 and when that day comes, I suspect it will become less egalitarian and a lot less fun.",
            "I\u2019ve been asked many times which branch of infosec is best to specialize in. I don\u2019t think it matters: there\u2019s enough jobs available even for those who want to focus on arcane subjects such as homomorphic encryption or CPU design. What\u2019s more important is knowing how it fits the big picture; otherwise, you\u2019ll struggle with threat models and might end up chasing ghosts.",
            "My final advice to new folks is to not look up to others. Judge your progress by looking back at your own work. The most talented folks I worked with didn\u2019t have their own Wikipedia pages and seldom entertained conference talks. At any given company, there\u2019s little overlap between your best-known employees and the ones you want to retain at any cost.",
            "The other insight I learned is that corporate life is all about results. If you see something that\u2019s bugging you, and nobody else is working on it, it\u2019s your problem to solve. There are no points awarded for telling others what to do or penning a scathing expose. Conversely, the surest way to get ahead is to develop a reputation as someone who solves problems \u2014 and does it well.",
            "The final skill to master is getting along with people you wouldn\u2019t be friends with in personal life. Most technical disagreements are personality clashes in disguise. It\u2019s best not to try and reform others; a better approach is to figure out what drives them and start speaking that language. In the same vein, don\u2019t let work become your entire life. It\u2019s hard to disengage from arguments when they feel like an attack on who you are.",
            "If you\u2019re a successful, senior engineer at a growing company, you will sooner or later be asked to become a manager. Most tech companies swear it\u2019s not a promotion, but the inescapable reality is that they have less room for \u201cchief architects\u201d or \u201cdistinguished engineers\u201d than for directors or VPs to take care of large orgs.",
            "For a newly-minted manager, the hardest skill to learn is knowing when to bite one\u2019s tongue. In our IC lives, we were paid to be the smartest person in the room: to have brilliant ideas, to argue for them with passion, and to crank out high-quality code. As managers, we\u2019re tasked with nourishing the next generation of technical leadership. The surest way to do this is to let people form their own opinions, try things out, and occasionally fail.",
            "When you become a manager, consider yourself on the hook for business outcomes, and not merely a collection of projects or processes owned by your folks. It\u2019s easy to get sucked into endless incremental improvements to such initiatives of without ever asking if the overall direction still makes sense for the company. If you don\u2019t ask these questions, somebody else will.",
            "Last but not least, expect your team to be sticklers for fairness. There\u2019s plenty of conspiratorial lore about why companies do performance management, but the simple answer is that if you don\u2019t, it will drive the people on your team insane. Whether they say it out loud or not, there are few things as demotivating as constantly bumping into a person who does much less than you, but gets paid the same or more. You should give low performers a fair shake, but don\u2019t let problems fester for too long.",
            "Time is a harsh mistress. A decade in front of a computer turns into three, children grow up and move out, a lifetime of microkitchen snacks brings about that diagnosis you didn\u2019t want to hear.",
            "I\u2019d wager that in retirement, few of us are going to look back with pride at all the OKRs we delivered or all the service metrics we improved. My advice is to engineer your life around what truly matters. Being able to retire in your 40s or 50s might be worth a lot more than living extravagantly in the early years of your career.",
            "A related suggestion is to avoid living paycheck-to-paycheck in tech. I survived the dot-com crash and the housing crisis \u2014 and learned this truth the hard way. I don\u2019t know what the future holds, but the industry is as volatile as it is lucrative; the shifts are far more sudden and far more ugly than most people expect.",

However, unlike some other LLM use cases, applications of AI in the medical field require the utmost focus on safety, equity, and bias to protect patient well-being.

Our models were tested against 14 criteria \u2014 including scientific factuality, precision, medical consensus, reasoning, bias and harm \u2014 and evaluated by clinicians and non-clinicians from a range of backgrounds and countries.

However, these causes or risk factors do not account for the majority of cases. Other, less visible factors must be at play. Among these is a widely used industrial solvent and common environmental contaminant little recognized for its likely role in PD: trichloroethylene (TCE). TCE is a simple, six-atom molecule that can decaffeinate coffee, degrease metal parts, and dry clean clothes. The colorless chemical was first linked to parkinsonism in 1969. Since then, four case studies involving eight individuals have linked occupational exposure to TCE to PD. In addition, a small epidemiological study found that occupational or hobby exposure to the solvent was associated with a 500% increased risk of developing PD. In multiple animal studies, the chemical reproduces the pathological features of PD.",
            "Exposure is not confined to those who work with the chemical. TCE pollutes outdoor air, taints groundwater, and contaminates indoor air. The molecule, like radon, evaporates from underlying soil and groundwater and enters homes, workplaces, or schools, often undetected. Despite widespread contamination and increasing industrial, commercial, and military use, clinical investigations of TCE and PD have been limited. Here, through a literature review and seven illustrative cases, we postulate that this ubiquitous chemical is contributing to the global rise of PD and that TCE is one of its invisible and highly preventable causes. Further research is now necessary to examine this hypothesis.",
            "The number of people with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) has more than doubled in the past 30 years [",
            "] and, absent change, will double again by 2040 [",
            "]. Numerous genetic causes or risk factors for the disease have been identified, but the vast majority of individuals with PD do not carry any of these mutations [",
            "]. Several environmental toxicants, especially certain pesticides [",
            "], have also been linked to PD, and head trauma is also associated with an increased risk [",

            "]. Indeed, in animal studies (",

            "In addition to combined environmental factors, evidence from preclinical studies suggests that genetic risk factors may also play a role in TCE-induced neurodegeneration. For example, in a 2021 study, chronic, systemic exposure to 200\u200amg/kg TCE elevated the kinase activity of LRRK2 (leucine rich repeat kinase 2) in the striatum and substantia nigra of rats after 3 weeks, prior to the loss of dopaminergic neurons at 6 weeks [",
            "]. Inherited variants of ",
            " are linked to both familial and sporadic PD, the most common of which is the G2019S mutation, that pathogenically elevate LRRK2 kinase activity resulting in dysregulated vesicular trafficking, endolysosomal dysfunction, and oxidative stress [",
            "]. However, despite cellular dysfunction caused by elevated LRRK2 kinase activity, individuals who inherit the ",
            " G2019S mutation have only a roughly 50% increased risk for PD [",
            "]. Incomplete penetrance of genetic risk factors suggests that possible gene-environment interactions could explain why only some individuals exposed to TCE develop PD and why those with a PD-related genetic predisposition may display variable risk of developing PD. Many other genetic causes of PD (e.g., ",
            ", ",
            ") also affect mitochondrial function, and an interaction with TCE is conceivable for carriers of mutations in these genes [",

            "In his early thirties, Mr. Jones worked for three to four years in a small copy and print shop that required multiple chemicals and solvents. He is unsure whether he was exposed to TCE or PCE, but chlorinated solvents were commonly used in the industry in the 1970s and 1980s [",
            "]. About 35 years later, he noticed that he was moving slower than his peers and was subsequently diagnosed with PD at age 68. His symptoms improved with levodopa, which he continues to take.",
            "Neither of his parents had PD, but his paternal grandfather did and his nephew does. In addition to PD, he was diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, a premalignant state associated with multiple myeloma, which is associated with TCE exposure [",
            "].",
            "After serving in the military, Mr. Alex Janssen worked in the construction and automotive industry. In these latter jobs, he worked with degreasing chemicals, such as TCE, for approximately seven years. About five years after his exposure ended, he noticed numbness on the right side of his body followed by difficulty walking up the stairs. He later experienced a stressful event that was followed by involuntary shaking in his right arm and leg and a PD diagnosis at age 33.",
            "The number and intensity of PD symptoms increased significantly over the years, and he eventually had deep brain stimulation (DBS), which improved his symptoms and his quality of life. Three years later, he developed fatigue, headache, and a facial droop. Brain imaging at age 53 revealed a stage IV glioblastoma situated next to a DBS wire.",
            "In 2020, Georgians took to the polls to elect two U.S. Senators in a closely watched election that would determine political control of the legislative body. The reason for the unusual election? Parkinson\u2019s disease. The late Senator Johnny Isakson, who was diagnosed with PD in 2015, had stepped down due to \u201chealth challenges\u201d in 2019, leading to a special election in 2020 [",
            "].",
            "Senator Johnny Isakson, who died in 2021 at age 76, served for fifteen years in the U.S. Senate during which time he was a staunch advocate for veterans and co-chaired the Congressional Caucus on Parkinson\u2019s Disease [",
            "]. In addition to his PD, Senator Isakson had a two-centimeter renal cell carcinoma removed from his kidney in 2019 [",
            "], a tumor associated with TCE exposure [",
            "].",
            "Nearly fifty years before his PD diagnosis, the future Senator served in the Georgia Air National Guard from 1966 to 1972. The military, including the Air Force, used TCE to degrease airplanes during this period [",
            "], and many military bases, including those in Georgia [",
            "], have been contaminated with the chemical [",
            "].",
            "As depicted by these cases, the adverse health effects associated with TCE extend far beyond PD. Its toxic effects begin shortly after conception. TCE can cross the placenta, [",
            "] and maternal exposure to TCE is associated with low birth weight [",
            "], congenital heart disease [",
            "], and neural tube defects [",
            "]. At the TCE-contaminated Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, at least seven babies had anencephaly, and ten had spina bifida [",
            "]. After birth, TCE-linked diseases proliferate as the solvent is linked to conditions affecting nearly every organ system [",
            "] including cancer.",
            "According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and World Health Organization, TCE is carcinogenic to humans by all routes of exposure [",
            "]. A meta-analysis found occupational exposure \u201cwas associated with excess incidences of liver cancer, kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma, with the strongest evidence for the first three cancers\u201d [",
            "]. This is likely only a partial list. At least 78 ",
            " who lived at contaminated Camp Lejeune have been diagnosed with breast cancer [",
            "]. In addition, high rates of brain and other central nervous system tumors have been reported in animal studies [",
            "] and in TCE-contaminated communities [",
            "].",
            "TCE\u2019s adverse health effects have long been known. In 1932, Dr. Carey McCord, a physician working for the Chrysler Corporation, wrote a letter to the ",
            ". He said that activities of TCE \u201cfrequently fail to disclose the toxic nature of this chemical and the practical dangers that may attend its use.\u201d He then detailed experiments with rabbits in which repeated skin exposure to the chemical caused death in days. Inhalation of TCE \u201cunder conditions of trivial exposure\u201d killed the rabbits in days if not hours. Ninety years ago, he concluded that the solvent could be \u201cthe source of disaster for exposed workmen\u201d [",
            "].",
            "The cases described demonstrate the potential role that TCE plays in PD. However, they are far from definitive and far from the only ones. The vignettes highlight many of the difficulties in establishing a strong link between the invisible TCE and PD. Among these are the following: 1) many are unaware of their exposure; 2) exposure, if present, was usually unmeasured; 3) previous exposures cannot currently be measured; 4) in many cases, exposure co-occurred with other pollutants; 5) time between exposure and disease is long; 6) underlying genetic risk factors, which are often not assessed, may augment the risk of developing PD following TCE exposure; and 7) diagnosis of PD is often delayed or missed.",
            "In just one of the cases above was the person\u2014 a physicist\u2014 aware of his exposure to the toxic chemical at the time it occurred, and all were unaware of the health risks associated with the chemical. Those who drank contaminated water or inhaled polluted air outside or inside their workplaces, schools, or homes generally had no idea that they were exposed. Today, sites known to be contaminated with TCE, including many of the most toxic ones in the U.S., have no warning signs, fences, notices, or other public notification of the inherent dangers. As a result, it is challenging to determine whether exposure occurred.",
            "Moreover, if exposure did occur, retrospective exposure assessment of TCE is difficult. Exposure is almost never measured contemporaneously (indeed, we are unaware of any case of PD associated with TCE where it was). Biomarkers of historical TCE exposure do not currently exist. The few studies [",
            "] and case reports [",
            "] available suggest that a dose-response relationship may be present as individuals who work most closely with the chemical have a shorter lag between exposure and disease onset.",
            "Like other environmental toxicants (e.g., smoking, pesticides), exposure to TCE is often combined with other exposures. Many TCE-contaminated sites are polluted with PCE and other toxic hydrocarbons such as benzene and carbon tetrachloride, which itself may be associated with PD.",
            "The effect of each individual compound has often not been assessed, and research into the risk of exposure to mixtures of toxicants is needed [",
            "].",
            "The time between exposure and disease onset may be decades. Individuals, if they were aware of their exposure to the chemical, may have long since forgotten about it. Those who worked with the solvent or who lived near a contaminated site may have changed jobs or moved, making retrospective evaluation of potential clusters challenging.",
            "Finally, while TCE\u2019s effects on cancer are well-documented, its effects on PD are only recently coming to light. Gash\u2019s study of factory workers who developed PD after degreasing metal parts with TCE was published in 2008 [",
            "]. The twin study quantifying the high degree of association between occupational or hobby exposure to TCE and PD is only ten years old [",
            "]. Many individuals who know they were exposed to TCE and subsequently developed PD have no reason to link the two. Today, most clinicians are unaware of TCE\u2019s deleterious health effects even though they have been documented for over ninety years [",
            "].",
            "To address the large role TCE (and other chlorinated solvents) may play in fueling the rise of PD, we need to do the following:",
            " ",
            " \u2013 Given the widespread environmental contamination by TCE, the authors of the twin study linking TCE to PD concluded, \u201cthe potential public health implications are substantial\u201d [",
            "]. Unfortunately, that prescient warning has largely gone unheeded. A search of TCE and PD on PubMed yields only 15 papers in the past decade [",
            "]. By contrast, a search of the genetic risk factor ",
            " and PD returns more published papers in just the last two months [",
            "]. Among the pressing research needs are evaluating cohorts (ideally prospectively) of individuals (likely) exposed to TCE, identifying biological markers of prior exposure, better understanding the mechanisms of injury, and assessing gene-environment interactions including those affecting TCE\u2019s metabolism. Further work is also needed to estimate the risk of TCE exposure in conjunction with other known neurotoxicants, such as pesticides, and risk factors like traumatic brain injury.",
            " ",
            " \u2013 Hundreds of thousands of sites are contaminated across the U.S. and globally. They are found in strip malls where dry cleaners used to operate, on military bases where use was widespread, in cities near old manufacturing sites (especially those near rivers or streams), and in rural areas where landfills were created to dump hazardous waste. Fortunately, contaminated sites can be remediated, and homes, schools, and workplaces can be protected by vapor intrusion mitigation systems like those used for radon [",
            "]. Until they are cleaned, existing contaminated sites must be contained, limiting exposure for humans and nature. Local, regional, and national authorities should take responsibility in overseeing rapid control of contaminated sites.",
            " ",
            " \u2013 Most databases monitor emissions, not current levels, and monitoring tends to be sporadic and reactive. TCE testing in groundwater, drinking water, soil, and in outdoor and indoor air should be widespread, frequent, and part of routine water quality testing. The results should be readily and publicly available. Polluted sites need to be marked as such, and the dangers to health clearly communicated to all parties at risk.",
            " ",
            " \u2013 In many ways, the long-established health risks of TCE dwarf its relationship with PD. TCE causes cancer, increases the risk of miscarriages, contributes to birth defects, and is associated with diseases in nearly every organ system. The chemical is over a century old. We do not fly airplanes from the days of the Wright brothers or drive cars from Henry Ford\u2019s era; engineers have developed safer ones. Chemists can do the same for solvents. Some companies now advertise safer alternatives to TCE [",
            "]. They are needed as the use of TCE continues to rise globally.",
            " ",
            " \u2013 Finally, we should listen to our patients more. In medicine, we often move from diagnosis to treatment without considering the cause. The vast majority of individuals with PD do not have a family history of the disease or carry an identifiable genetic risk factor. Listening to their life stories or occupational histories can help identify TCE or other factors contributing to PD and could help develop etiology-specific treatments. This information can also inform their care (e.g., cancer screening), provide guidance to family members, co-workers, and classmates, and advance our understanding of the potential causes of this debilitating and likely very preventable disease.",
            "For more than a century, TCE has threatened workers, polluted the air we breathe\u2014 outside and inside\u2014 and contaminated the water we drink. Global use is waxing, not waning. Most of this has been invisible, all of it is unacceptable, and none of it will stop until we act.",

Unlike the great meme stock rally of 2021, this brouhaha revolves around put options and how users of the broker\u2019s app aren\u2019t able to cash in on the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank even as their bets are in the money.",
            "Put options are a way for investors to wager that the price of a stock will decline. If the stock does go down, the trader can sell the shares at a higher price than market value, making a profit. Or they can sell the contract to someone else who thinks the shares will fall even further. If it works, it\u2019s like winning the lottery with the added bonus of also getting to revel in someone else\u2019s failure.",
            "In the case of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, some Robinhood users saw the writing on the wall and purchased put options on the stocks before they collapsed. Of course, the banks did collapse. It should\u2019ve been a windfall for those who saw trouble brewing.",
            "The problem is, according to users of the trading app, Robinhood isn\u2019t allowing them to sell their contracts or get paid. A slew of the contracts are set to expire on Friday. That\u2019s got some of them miffed.",
            "Robinhood, which didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment, has its reasons for not letting users exercise their options. The shares aren\u2019t trading anymore, so it\u2019s a bit of a logistical nightmare to buy the shares if you don\u2019t already own them to satisfy the contract. There aren\u2019t a lot of people looking to buy the contracts right now given that the stocks are already on the operating room table and there\u2019s not much, if any, downside left to capitalize on.",
            "Robinhood isn\u2019t the only exchange that isn\u2019t following through, according to retail options traders. Fidelity, which didn\u2019t immediately return requests for comment, has also taken a social-media beatdown for its failure to pay up. Unsurprisingly, given its history, Robinhood seems to be the punching bag of choice.",
            "That\u2019s not stopping users from asking the all-important question: why were they even allowed to buy put contracts on stocks they didn\u2019t own in the first place if that were a condition for getting paid if a situation like this played out?",
            "The Robinhood mobile trading app was designed to democratize finance, to bring the power of the markets to the people, to disrupt the old boys\u2019 club of Wall Street. Yet, when the great meme stock rally of 2021 erupted, Robinhood found itself frozen, like a frightened puppy, as the surging demand for GameStop and other meme stocks threatened to overwhelm the platform\u2019s infrastructure. The company\u2019s wallet, it turned out, wasn\u2019t deep enough to accommodate the rapid increase in trades, leaving Robinhood responsible for more than it could afford. The result was a near-death experience followed by Congressional hearings that bordered on must-see TV and a yearlong investigation by the House Financial Services Committee that concluded the app was closer to flatlining than it let on at the time.",
            "Just like the meme stock episode, this week\u2019s simmering put-option scandal goes to show that even the best bets can end up worthless.",
            "There\u2019s a touch of irony to the situation. In 2021, WallStreetBets users complained that Gabe Plotkin\u2019s Melvin Capital, among others, held naked short positions against GameStop \u2014 meaning they didn\u2019t own GameStop shares to deliver on their bets against the stock. Now, Robinhood and other brokers are saying put contracts, which to be clear aren\u2019t the same as naked shorts, can\u2019t be executed because the shares can\u2019t be bought. It\u2019s all a little too on the nose.",
            "As Twitter lights up with complaints from Robinhood users, well-known short-seller Marc Cohodes offers a bit of advice: call a lawyer. He\u2019s also promising that there will be \u201chell to pay\u201d if Robinhood or any other broker looks to \u201cscrew Joe Six-Pack.\u201d Stay tuned."

Coming from a subtropical climate, Alaska was definitely not on his bucket list (it wasn\u2019t even a state back then!) yet it became his home for a few years. My grandfather continued to take any jobs that were available until he managed to return to the mainland US.\u00a0\u00a0",

The restaurant was ostensibly a Chinese restaurant but he cooked whatever a customer wanted. Better to make up a dish than to turn a customer away. All to support his family back in China and eventually bring them to the US.",

When one brother found an opening, he brought the others. They hop-scotched across the country from the west coast to Virginia.\u00a0",
            "Among other things, this grandfather became a mechanic, a bartender, a cleaner. He wasn\u2019t the best at any, but he learned enough to pay the bills. He finally settled in New York City and opened a laundromat.",
            "My grandfathers accomplished everything they set out to do when they left China.\u00a0 They not only supported and helped their relatives in China to emigrate, but they had thriving families of their own. They accomplished their goals, but I doubt they knew the winding journey it would take.\u00a0",

You\u2019re a \"founder and CEO\", and every day you work hard to make that idea a reality. But every day, life throws obstacles at you; random things that seem to conspire to put you off course. And chances are that sooner or later, you will tumble off the mountain and your dream will crumble. It may sound harsh, but reality doesn't care. Destiny is not guaranteed to reward your hard work.",
            "Most people never consider that just being on the mountain can be enough. The pinnacle doesn't matter. If it happens, it happens, but it shouldn\u2019t even be on your radar. Your only goal is to survive the mountain; to avoid having your new lifestyle taken away from you. This may sound mediocre and uninspiring, but in reality, it's extremely liberating. Once you start to think of yourself as a cockroach \u2014 just trying to survive \u2014 you free yourself from the constraints of walking that precarious path to the top of the mountain. The random things that life throws at you won't always harm you. Sometimes the obstacles can actually help you. Sometimes they show you an opportunity that until a minute before you didn't even know existed.\u00a0 And you can seize that opening because you\u2019re not fixated on a remote summit.",

            "The electron transport chain is a series of four protein complexes that couple redox reactions, creating an electrochemical gradient that leads to the creation of ATP in a complete system named oxidative phosphorylation. It occurs in mitochondria in both cellular respiration and photosynthesis. In the former, the electrons come from breaking down organic molecules, and energy is released. In the latter, the electrons enter the chain after being excited by light, and the energy released is used to build carbohydrates.",
            "Aerobic cellular respiration is made up of three parts: glycolysis, the citric acid (Krebs) cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. In glycolysis, glucose metabolizes into two molecules of pyruvate, with an output of ATP and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Each pyruvate oxidizes into acetyl CoA and an additional molecule of NADH and carbon dioxide (CO2). The acetyl CoA is then used in the citric acid cycle, which is a chain of chemical reactions that produce CO2, NADH, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2), and ATP. In the final step, the three NADH and one FADH2 amassed from the previous steps are used in oxidative phosphorylation, to make water and ATP.",
            "Oxidative phosphorylation has two parts: the electron transport chain (ETC) and chemiosmosis. The ETC is a collection of proteins bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane and organic molecules, which electrons pass through in a series of redox reactions, and release energy. The energy released forms a proton gradient, which is used in chemiosmosis to make a large amount of ATP by the protein ATP-synthase.",
            "Photosynthesis is a metabolic process that converts light energy into chemical energy to build sugars. In the light-dependent reactions, light energy and water are used to make ATP, NADPH, and oxygen (O2). The proton gradient used to make the ATP forms via an electron transport chain. In the light-independent reactions, sugar is made from the ATP and NADPH from the previous reactions.",
            "In the electron transport chain (ETC), the electrons go through a chain of proteins that increases its reduction potential and causes a release in energy. Most of this energy is dissipated as heat or utilized to pump hydrogen ions (H+) from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space and create a proton gradient. This gradient increases the acidity in the intermembrane space and creates an electrical difference with a positive charge outside and a negative charge inside. The ETC proteins in a general order are complex I, complex II, coenzyme Q, complex III, cytochrome C, and complex IV.",
            "ATP synthase, also called complex V, uses the ETC generated proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane to form ATP. ATP-synthase contains up of F0 and F1 subunits, which act as a rotational motor system. F0 is hydrophobic and embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It contains a\u00a0proton corridor that is protonated and deprotonated repeatedly as H+ ions flow down the gradient from intermembrane space to matrix. The alternating ionization of F0 causes rotation, which alters the orientation of the F1 subunits. F1 is hydrophilic and faces the mitochondrial matrix. Conformational changes in F1 subunits catalyze the formation of ATP from ADP and Pi. For every 4 H+ ions, 1 ATP is produced. ATP-synthase can also be forced to run in reverse, consuming ATP to produce a hydrogen gradient, as is seen in some bacteria.",
            "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide has two forms: NAD+ (oxidized) and NADH (reduced). It is a dinucleotide connected by phosphate groups. One nucleoside has an adenine base and the other nicotinamide. When involved in metabolic redox reactions, the mechanism is as shown in Reaction 1.",
            "R is the reactant, for example, sugar.",
            "NADH enters the ETC at complex I and produces a total of 10 H+ ions through the ETC (4 from complex I, 4 from complex III, and 2 from complex IV). ATP-synthase synthesizes 1 ATP for 4 H+ ions. Therefore, 1 NADH = 10 H+, and 10/4 H+ per ATP = 2.5 ATP per NADH (**some sources round up**). When NADH is oxidized, it breaks into NAD+, H+, and 2 e- as shown in Reaction 2.",
            "Flavin adenine dinucleotide has 4 redox states, 3 of them being FAD (quinone, fully oxidized form), FADH- (semiquinone, partially oxidized), and FADH2 (hydroquinone, fully reduced). FAD is made up of an adenine nucleotide and a flavin mononucleotide (FMN), connected by phosphate groups. FMN is synthesized in part from vitamin B2 (riboflavin). FAD contains a highly stable aromatic ring, and FADH2 does not. When FADH2 oxidizes, it becomes aromatic and releases energy, as seen in Reaction 3. This state makes FAD a potent oxidizing agent, with an even more positive reduction potential than NAD. FADH2 enters the ETC at complex II and creates a total of 1.5 ATP (4 H+ from complex III, and 2 H+ from complex IV; 6/4 H+ per ATP = 1.5 ATP per FADH2 **some sources round up**).",
            "FAD\u00a0also functions in several metabolic pathways outside of the ETC, including DNA repair (MTHF repair of UV damage), fatty acid beta-oxidation (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), and synthesis of coenzymes (CoA, CoQ, heme).",

            "An uncoupling agent dissociates the electron transport chain from phosphorylation by ATP-synthase, preventing the formation of ATP. Disruption of the phospholipid bilayer of membranes causes a fluid-like and disorganized state, which allows protons to flow through more freely. This proton leak weakens the electrochemical gradient, while also transferring protons without the use of ATP-synthase such that no ATP is produced.\u00a0",
            "While the cell becomes starved of ATP, the ETC will overwork in an attempt to shuttle more and more electrons to ATP-synthase without success. The ETC regularly produces heat as the electrons transfer from one carrier to the next, and this overactivity will raise the body temperature as a result. Additionally, cells will adapt to utilizing fermentation as if in anaerobic conditions; this may cause a type B lactic acidosis in affected patients.",

I also had this image of sawdust spewing out instead of blood when characters are slashed, since the characters are all made of wood. ",
            "These imaginations really excited me, and I really believed that they would result in a unique and never-before-seen animated film. When I proposed this idea to the team, they loved it and said, \u201cLet\u2019s do this!\u201d and thus the long production began.",
            "One-and-a-half years of production time. Over 60 staff members. Two Jingor\u014d puppets, one Inumaru puppet, five henchmen puppets, one Inumaru robot, one sleeping cat puppet (with five motion-blur models) and one armchair dog puppet. Five filming stages. Fourteen scenarios (which ended up being cut down to mostly action scenes, to focus on the visual qualities more than the narrative for this pilot film). Lots of love, sweat, tears and sawdust.",
            "Yes, we took many cues from action scenes in 2D animation, especially classic \u201cJapanimation.\u201d We really wanted to bring dynamic action sequences into stop-motion animation, since we\u2019ve never seen it done before. ",
            "From there, we noted where we wanted to make further adjustments to the motion, lens and camera angles, and drafted a production plan that allowed us to achieve them all.",
            "Basically, everything was challenging [smile]. The animators were saying that animating just one Jingor\u014d puppet was like moving three puppets at once, since he\u2019s bigger than a usual puppet for animation (40 cm), and his proportions do not allow him to stand up on his own, so he had to be lifted up by a rig all the time. ",
            "I personally felt the \u201csmear frames\u201d (or motion blur effects) of the chainsaw were a nightmare to film, because they had to be hung by invisible wires to keep their shape, and we had to detach and move them one frame at a time\u2026",
            "The collaboration was amazingly smooth, because I guess everyone really rooted for this idea. Everyone gave 120%, which I think resulted in this high-quality pilot film.",
            "Now that we have the pilot film completed, we plan to use it as a tool to approach various production and distribution companies and seek their collaboration in turning this into a full-length film. I hope we can show the feature film to our supporters, as soon as we can.",

            "Researchers came across a viral video of a male gorilla spinning in a pool, and as they continued researching YouTube, came across more videos of gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans all engaging in spinning behaviours.",
            "Analysing over 40 online videos of apes spinning on ropes and vines, the experts found that on average the primates revolved 5.5 times per episode of spinning, with the average speed 1.5 revolutions per second and the primates did this on average three times.",
            "Spinning is a way in which great apes can change their state of mind and, since these apes share with humans the tendency to create such experiences, our discovery offers the tantalising prospect that we\u2019ve inherited this drive to seek altered mental states from our evolutionary ancestors.",
            "Publishing their findings in ",
            ", researchers from the Universities of Birmingham and Warwick compared great ape spinning speeds - discovering that they can spin while holding on a rope as fast as professional human dancers and circus artists, as well as Dervish Muslims who take part in whirling ceremonies to achieve a spiritual trance.",
            "Dr Marcus Perlman, Lecturer at the Department of English Language and Linguistics of the University of Birmingham who co-led the research, commented: \u201cWe experimented ourselves with spinning at these speeds, and found it difficult to sustain for as long the great apes did in several cases.",
            "\u201cApes became noticeably dizzy in many of the videos, and they were likely to lose their balance and fall. This would indicate that the primates deliberately keep spinning, despite starting to feel the effects of dizziness, until they are unable to keep their balance any longer.\u201d",
            "\u201cSpinning is a way in which great apes can change their state of mind and, since these apes share with humans the tendency to create such experiences, our discovery offers the tantalising prospect that we\u2019ve inherited this drive to seek altered mental states from our evolutionary ancestors.\u201d",
            "In the videos analysed, the primates were using ropes or vines to spin, which the authors believe enabled them to achieve such fast speeds for such an extended period of time. Researchers analysed the videos and compared the apes\u2019 behaviour to videos of purposeful human pirouettes, for example, ",
            ", traditional Hopak dancing, and ",
            "Dr Adriano Lameira, Associate Professor of Psychology at The University of Warwick who co-led the study, commented: \u201cEvery culture has found a way of evading reality through dedicated and special rituals, practices, or ceremonies. This human trait of seeking altered states is so universal, historically, and culturally, that it raises the intriguing possibility that this is something that has been potentially inherited from our evolutionary ancestors.",
            "\u201cIf this was indeed the case, it would carry huge consequences on how we think about modern human cognition capacities and emotional needs. Spinning alters our state of consciousness, it messes up with our body-mind responsiveness and coordination, which make us feel sick, lightheaded, and even elated as in the case on children playing in merry-go-rounds, spinner-wheels, and carousels.\u201d",
            "The researchers sought to understand whether spinning can be studied as a primordial behaviour that human ancestors could have engaged in to tap into other states of consciousness. If all great apes seek dizziness, then our ancestors were also highly likely to have done so.",
            "Previous studies which attempted to understand human motivation for self-inducing dizziness focused on substance use such as alcohol or drugs, but it is uncertain whether these or other substances would have been accessible to human ancestors, either because those substances were not available in their environment or because individuals and communities didn\u2019t have the technical and cultural knowledge to produce or process psychoactive substances. Scientists say this new study could be more relevant to explain the role of altered states on the evolution of the human mind.",
            "The scientists say that further research is needed to understand primates\u2019 motivations for engaging in these behaviours, to understand why our own ancestors might also have been driven to seek out these spinning and mind-altering experiences.",

            " for legislators to introduce microlegislation catering to a narrow interest is greater if the threat of exposure is lower. To strengthen the threat of exposure for misbehaving legislative sponsors, bills should focus more tightly on individual substantive areas and, after the introduction of amendments, allow more time before the committee and floor votes. During this time, we should encourage public review and testimony to provide greater oversight.",
            "Second, we should strengthen disclosure requirements on lobbyists, whether they\u2019re entirely human or AI-assisted. State laws regarding lobbying disclosure are a hodgepodge. North Dakota, for example, only ",

            " to get something substantive back. But we can expect more\u2014lobbyists could be required to proactively publish, within a few days, a brief summary of what they demanded of policymakers during meetings and why they believe it\u2019s in the general interest.",
            "We can\u2019t rely on corporations to be forthcoming and wholly honest about the reasons behind their lobbying positions. But having them on the record about their intentions would at least provide a baseline for accountability.",
            "Finally, consider the role AI assistive technologies may have on lobbying firms themselves and the labor market for lobbyists. Many observers are rightfully ",
            " about the possibility of AI replacing or devaluing the human labor it automates. If the automating potential of AI ends up commodifying the work of political strategizing and message development, it may indeed put some professionals on K Street out of work.",

The language runtime normally manages your memory, doesn't expose the kinds of APIs that could cause these issues, and enforces its own rules on the APIs that are available, to guarantee that your code behaves correctly.",

It's worth a go though, and you don't need to understand the code perfectly to do this. In many cases you'll quickly spot a comment or clue for why this crash could occur, that'll lead you back to a nice clean fix in your own JavaScript.",

Any of these can easily mean that a minor bug in your code results in the addon's native code doing completely the wrong thing, and crashing the whole process.",

            "In the United States, the banking system as a whole has $22.9 trillion in assets and $20.7 trillion in liabilities. The problem, of course, is that their assets are riskier and less liquid than their liabilities, and so they face both liquidity risks and solvency risks if things aren\u2019t managed well, or if they face external shocks that are larger than they can deal with.",
            "We can quantify this another way. The majority of bank liabilities are deposits for individuals and businesses, and these deposits currently total $17.6 trillion. That\u2019s what you and I consider to be our \u201cmoney\u201d. They offer very low interest rates, especially for checking and savings accounts.",
            "Deposits are fractionally-reserve bank IOUs; when you see $10,000 in your account balance for example, that figure is not actually backed up by dollars. Instead, that figure is backed up by a broad mix of less-liquid assets including Treasuries, mortgage loans, credit card loans, business loans, a bunch of other assets, and then a small percentage of actual dollars.",
            "Banks currently have just $3 trillion in cash to back up their $17.6 trillion in deposits. The majority of this cash is just a ledger entry with the U.S. Federal Reserve, and so it is not tangible. Somewhere around $100 billion of it ($0.1 trillion) is held by banks in the form of actual physical banknotes in vaults and ATMs. So, the $17.6 trillion in deposits are backed up by just $3 trillion in cash, of which perhaps $0.1 trillion is physical cash. The rest is backed up by less liquid securities and loans.",
            "Back in 2008, banks had 23 dollars of deposit liabilities for every dollar they had in liquid cash, which is insanely leveraged and illiquid. Due to quantitative easing and a slew of new requirements, their ratios aren\u2019t that high anymore, and so it\u2019s more like a 5x or 6x ratio these days.",
            "From a depositor perspective, banks are basically highly-leveraged bond funds with payment services attached, and we treat it as normal to keep our savings in them.",
            "To help normalize that and make it seem less weird, the FDIC provides insurance against deposit losses up to $250,000 which mitigates some of the risk. However, at any given time, FDIC only has about 1% of bank deposits\u2019 worth of insurance in their fund. They can protect depositors against individual bank failures, but they don\u2019t have enough to prevent against system-wide banking failures, unless they draw in aid from elsewhere or are backstopped by Congress with a fiscal bailout.",
            "Some banks, such as TNB Inc. and others, have attempted to make bank models that just store all of their assets as cash at the Federal Reserve and therefore operate full-reserve banks, but they have not been allowed by the Federal Reserve to exist. This would basically be the safest possible bank, but if it were allowed to exist it could suck deposits out from other banks, threaten the whole fractional-reserve banking model, and reduce the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to control monetary policy.",
            "So ironically, regulators want banks to be reasonably safe, but not \u201ctoo safe\u201d. They want all banks to be leveraged bond funds to a certain degree, and won\u2019t allow safer ones to exist.",
            "Back in 2008, banks in aggregate had a credit problem. They made risky loans, they had very little safe assets, and some of those risky loans started to default. Given how leveraged they were, it wouldn\u2019t take much to render large portions of the U.S. banking system insolvent.",
            "This chart shows banks\u2019 holdings of cash and Treasuries (the safest assets in terms of credit risk) as a percentage of total bank assets:",
            "As we can see, the 2008 situation was very different than what\u2019s happening here in 2023. Today, banks have a much higher ratio of their assets in cash and Treasury/agency securities, which are nominally risk free if held to maturity. Banks also have a much higher cash-to-deposit ratio in 2023 than 2008. In addition, the rest of their asset base is in better shape in terms of credit risk too: on average banks have less subprime lending exposure, and instead they are rather concentrated into providing loans to entities with decent credit metrics.",
            "So what\u2019s the problem? This time the problem is liquidity and duration (interest rate) risk. This is similar to the 2019 repo spike, but more severe. Some of the safest securities that banks own might not have credit risk, but they do have duration risk. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates at the quickest absolute pace in decades (a 4.49% move in one year), and the quickest percentage pace of all time (from 0.08% to 4.57% in one year, or a 57x increase).",
            "Banks were given a ton of new deposits during 2020 and 2021 thanks to fiscal stimulus to people, and banks used those deposits to buy a lot of securities, which were low-yielding at the time. After a year of rapid interest rate increases, the prices of those fixed income securities are now lower than they were when banks bought them.",
            "In other words, if they bought a 10-year Treasury note when yields were 1.5%, and today they are 4%, then those older Treasuries will be discounted in terms of price by about 15-20% by any potential buyers, so that they have the same effective yield to maturity (4%) as these newer Treasuries do.",
            "Due to buying so many securities when interest rates were low that are now heavily discounted if they were to be sold, banks have a lot of unrealized losses.",
            "Over $600 billion worth of unrealized losses, in fact:",
            "That seems quite \u201cdoomy\u201d at first, but there\u2019s good news. Normally, banks can hold these securities to maturity and get all of their money back. That\u2019s why they are classified into the \u201chold to maturity\u201d segment. And unlike 2008, most of this has little or no credit default risk, so if they can hold on, they\u2019re fine.",
            "However, if depositors pull their money out of a bank above and beyond the amount of cash that the bank has on hand, then that bank might have to sell securities at a loss, rather than hold onto securities until maturity as planned. If that happens, it can turn a liquidity problem into a solvency problem, not because the securities are defaulting like they did in 2008, but instead because the banks are selling otherwise high-quality securities at a loss (due to those securities being priced at a discount in light of recent interest rate increases) and locking in those losses. The unrealized losses become realized losses for banks that can\u2019t keep their deposits from running away.",
            "So, the irony of the situation is that a bank can literally fail even if they hold 100% nominally risk-free assets that are guaranteed to be paid back in full. If a bank uses depositor funds to buy those assets at low interest rates for lack of anything better to buy at the time, and then those assets go on to trade at a discount due to higher interest rates by an amount that exceeds the bank\u2019s capital, and then the bank is forced by a depositor run to sell those assets for a realized loss rather than holding them to maturity and getting their money back as they intended, then the bank is bankrupt.",
            "Silicon Valley Bank had 1) a ton of recent new deposits from one concentrated industry, 2) an unusually high number of large depositors (business-sized accounts) that were not covered by FDIC, and 3) an unusually high ratio of securities with unrealized losses relative to its total capital. Therefore, due to weak risk management practices, it was uniquely vulnerable to this type of depositor rug-pull that made them sell securities at a big loss. A number of other banks, especially ones focused on serving large depositors above the FDIC limit (and thus highly exposed to a bank run), have found themselves in a similar position, so there has been a localized contagion among banks that have similar asset and deposit profiles to Silicon Valley Bank.",
            "On one hand, the $17.6 trillion in bank deposits in aggregate can\u2019t all flow somewhere and wreck the whole banking sector with realized losses by forcing them to sell. Other markets including Treasury securities wouldn\u2019t be big enough to absorb an outflow from bank deposits at that scale. Money markets are the most expandable option but would likely be blocked if inflows go out of control. And physical cash certainly isn\u2019t an option; with only around $100 billion in nationwide bank vault cash on hand, if too many deposits try to come out in physical form, they\u2019ll get told \u201cno\u201d since banks have hardly any physical cash.",
            "So, most of the top ten banks are big enough that it\u2019s hard to pull enough deposits out to make them sell any of their securities for realized losses. It\u2019s not impossible, but it\u2019s hard. So far, the large regional banks and the huge money-center banks are not reporting major deposit outflows.",
            "On the other hand, any given small or medium-sized bank with unrealized losses on their book is indeed quite vulnerable. It\u2019s easy for deposits to move around and concentrate into the larger banks and money markets, leaving a lot of smaller banks out of liquidity and forced to sell their less liquid assets at a loss. Small banks with significant cash on hand, less unrealized losses relative to bank capital, and a large number of small depositors (rather than a small number of large depositors) are generally as safer relative to others in the peer group.",
            "Due to the low credit risk of most bank assets, I certainly don\u2019t see it as a \u201c2008 repeat\u201d like many commentators on social media have recently. Does this acutely threaten the whole financial system? No.",
            "Is it a serious liquidity concern for many banks outside of the top ten or so? Absolutely. And that\u2019s why the Treasury and Federal Reserve stepped in.",
            "Back in 2018 and 2019, the Federal Reserve was performing quantitative tightening or \u201cQT\u201d, meaning they were letting bonds mature off of their balance sheet and thus destroying bank reserves. They were sucking liquidity out of the banking system as a method of tightening monetary policy.",
            "This worked until September 2019 when the repo rate suddenly blew out. The repo rate is an important overnight financing method between financial institutions.",
            "When that happened, the Federal Reserve stepped in the next day by lending in the repo market directly. They also stopped doing quantitative tightening. At the time, I wrote that the repo spike was mostly a problem of too many T-bills flooding the market, and the Federal Reserve would likely have to step in and buy some of them (a form of quantitative easing or \u201cQE\u201d). In other words, while the problem was initially showing up in the repo market, it was ultimately a matter of T-bill oversupply.",
            "A few weeks later in October 2019, the Federal Reserve indeed began ",
            ", even though on its surface it was a repo problem:",
            "However, they insisted that their purchase of T-bills was \u201c",
            "\u201d because the intention wasn\u2019t for stimulus. It was for financial stability. That\u2019s a polite way of saying \u201cforced deficit monetization due to fiscal dominance\u201d.",
            "A few months later in spring 2020 due to the pandemic and lockdowns, the Federal Reserve did switch to doing outright QE, and at a massive scale. They bought many types of securities throughout 2020 and 2021. But that period of buying of T-bills from October 2019 into early 2020 was for financial stability and deficit monetization reasons rather than stimulus purposes.",
            "Starting in 2022, in the face of high inflation, the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates and resume a period of QT, to try to tightening monetary policy and reduce inflation. Each month, they are letting securities mature off of their balance sheet, and retire those reserves. This once again sucks money out of the banking system. And once again, it contributed to banking problems.",
            "This time it wasn\u2019t a problem of too many T-bills. In fact, there is a arguably an undersupply of T-bills currently. Instead, this is a problem of banks having low cash levels relative to how much illiquid securities and loans they have, even if most of those securities and loans have good credit profiles (unlikely to default).",
            "More specifically, it was small banks that were ",
            " more quickly than large banks this time. This chart shows cash as a percentage of total assets for small banks and large banks:",
            "Here in 2023, small banks are already back down to cash levels they had at the time of the 2019 repo spike, while large banks aren\u2019t yet. This draining of liquidity has sucked cash out of smaller banks at a faster rate than large banks, which didn\u2019t really happen during the 2018-2019 period of quantitative tightening.",
            "This chart shows cash as a percentage of total deposits for small banks and large banks, and indicates the same problem:",
            "This difference in the speed of cash drain between large and small banks was under my radar in recent months. I was mostly looking at the banking system as a whole, which in terms of assets mainly means the big banks. However, the problem this time specifically originated in the long tail of small and medium-sized banks, as well as banks with unusual depositor profiles, and I don\u2019t invest in either of those categories from an equity perspective due to their higher risk level.",
            "As a result of this uneven cash drain, I think it will be pretty hard for the Federal Reserve to continue interest rate increases and quantitative tightening for much longer. They could continue it for a few months more into mid-year if the Treasury General Account draws down quickly enough and offsets some of it, but outside of that, it seems that continuing to reduce the amount of bank reserves in the system risks putting a lot of banks outside of the top ten banks into a persistent liquidity problem.",
            "On Sunday night, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve ",
            " called the Bank Term Funding Program \u201cBTFP\u201d which lets banks use various securities at face value for loan collateral, rather than having to sell them. This gives banks a lot more liquidity against bank runs for now, but just papers over the underlying problem.",
            "If the Federal Reserve does continue to push forward by raising interest rates and performing quantitative tightening, the long tail of small and medium-sized banks are at risk of ongoing liquidity drains, starting with the most vulnerable and moving up from there. If the small banks sharply raise interest rates to keep deposits, then they risk getting into solvency problems. The beneficiaries of this flight to safety would most likely be several of the the largest banks and money market funds.",
            "Due to the way the system inherently operates, there has been a long-term consolidation of small banks into big banks, and this recent episode provides more fuel for that trend.",
            "In 1971, according to FDIC, there were 13,612 banks in the country with 23,336 branches. Fifty years later, in 2021, there were only 4,237 banks with 72,405 branches. Although the population increased and the number of branches increased (not to mention all of the online banking that the industry shifted wards), the number of separate banks dropped dramatically and consolidated into fewer, larger ones. And even those statistics understate the level of concentration; in 2022 the top ten banks alone had approximately half of all bank assets, with the other 4,200+ banks combined holding the other half.",
            "The more the Federal Reserve tries to push interest rate increases and quantitative tightening in this business cycle, the more they will likely benefit the mega-cap J.P. Morgan Chase\u2019s of the world over the small community banks, as reserves will likely continue to drain out of the smaller banks and threaten their liquidity profiles. The Federal Reserve\u2019s BTFP on its own won\u2019t prevent this process; it just make the liquidity drain out of small banks less disorderly.",
            "There is nearly $2.2 trillion sitting in reverse repos, and this aspect is very different than the 2018/2019 period of quantitative tightening:",
            "A lot of this is held by money markets; people hold their dollars in money market funds, and those funds stick that cash into the Federal Reserve. The Fidelity Government Money Market Fund, for example, has $245 billion in assets, of which 72% are in reverse repos with the Federal Reserve.",
            "Technically, this $2.2 trillion in reverse repos could be drained and pulled back into bank deposits and bank reserves. If that were the case, the Federal Reserve could still have a long runway of quantitative tightening ahead. However, reverse repo exposure has a higher yield and is backed up by the Federal Reserve, so why would that money want to go back into banks, and especially small banks?",
            "The main way to suck dollars out of reverse repos would be for banks to raise depositor interest rates and entice dollars out of money markets and back into deposits. The problem is that those who don\u2019t need to raise deposit rates very much (the big banks) are the ones that could, and the ones who do need to raise deposit rates (the small banks) are the ones that would have trouble doing so. If a bank raises its deposit rates too much while holding low-yielding securities, then they risk having operating losses and solvency problems.",
            "The secondary way to suck money out of reverse repos would be for the U.S. Treasury to issue a ton of T-bills. However, due to the debt ceiling impasse, they cannot. So, that money is pretty much stuck there for at least a while.",
            "The constraint is basically that total domestic liquidity (the Fed\u2019s balance sheet minus the Treasury General Account minus reverse repos) will have a hard time going much below the red line in the chart below, unless it is offset by widening usage of liquidity facilities like the BTFP:",
            "When domestic liquidity first hit that red line in late September 2022, the U.S. Treasury security market started to become quite illiquid, and the U.K. sovereign bond market outright broke and required liquidity intervention by the Bank of England. Since then, domestic liquidity has trended sideways, as reductions in the Treasury General Account have offset reductions in the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet, and things avoided breaking until recently when the Federal Reserve had to step in with liquidity intervention to prevent bank runs.",
            "-Unlike 2008, most of the large banks don\u2019t appear to have credit problems from over-aggressive lending, and they are less at risk of liquidity draining from them than small banks. Therefore, most large banks are in decent shape.",
            "-Smaller banks, meanwhile, aren\u2019t out of the woods yet due to the combination of less cash on hand and significant unrealized losses sitting on their balance sheets. The majority of them, at least the publicly-traded ones, don\u2019t have the acute solvency problems that Silicon Valley Bank had, but if they raise deposit rates to try to keep deposits then they do risk experiencing a solvency problem.",
            "-Policymakers will be watching the liquidity situation closely at this point, and are likely to find it difficult to keep moving forward with interest rate increases and quantitative tightening for much longer. Specifically, total U.S. bank reserves probably can\u2019t go much below the current $3 trillion level without corresponding increases in the usage of liquidity facilities.",
            "-If the Federal Reserve is unable to keep up the combination of interest rate increases and quantitative tightening for much longer due to hurting small banks too much, despite price inflation still being above-target, then a basket of anti-dollar positions such as gold, oil, commodities, emerging markets, and bitcoin would likely benefit.",
            "-Despite the recent actions that made even uninsured depositors whole, bank depositors should ensure they are under the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit, if possible. For amounts above that, T-bills and money market accounts are preferable. They are safer and higher yielding, for amounts of money that don\u2019t need bank-specific services (e.g. payments). The biggest challenge is for businesses, because they need to deal with bank accounts and payments in large amounts. They can split their activities among a number of banks, can use sweeps to move unneeded funds into money markets, and can do other protective measures.",

            "Central banks such as the Federal Reserve hold long-duration assets such as Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities as their assets, while their liabilities are shorter-term, including bank reserves, physical banknotes, and reverse repos.",
            "Normally, a central bank\u2019s assets have higher interest rates than their liabilities do, resulting in operating profits for the central bank. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is required to send its operating profits to the U.S. Treasury Department as remittances, and in recent years they have been around $100 billion per year (enough to fund NASA four times over).",
            "However, because central banks raised interest rates so quickly in 2022, many of them now have liabilities that have higher interest rates than their assets. The Federal Reserve is running operating losses to the tune of ~$2 billion per week due to this, and they are no longer sending remittances to the U.S. Treasury.",
            "The Federal Reserve already has deeply negative capital (about -$1 trillion or so) if we mark its assets to market. Aside from that, the Federal Reserve will reach negative tangible capital in a couple weeks even without marking assets to market, due to ongoing operating losses from paying out higher interest rates on its liabilities than its assets. The accounting method of treating its cumulative losses as \u201cdeferred assets\u201d and avoiding mark-to-market accounting is what\u2019s keeping it solvent on paper.",
            "Fortunately as a central bank, it\u2019s not subject to bank runs in the same way that individual banks are (especially small banks) and doesn\u2019t go out of business if it has negative tangible capital or operating losses.",

For example, plenty of companies have ambassador programs open to all customers to engage, connect, or talk to like-minded folks and learn more about the product,\u201d says Bryant.",
            "\u201cTo go deeper here, perhaps with those mid-market accounts, you can introduce councils where customers can sit down with the product marketing team to learn more about our product, challenge the product, test out new features, and so on.\u201d",
            "\u201cOnce you have an established community, the customer will very likely be interested in upleveling their existing relationship with your product and identifying more ways you can add value to their organization and employees,\u201d says Bryant. \u201cThis is where VIP customer experiences make sense, and those events could include executive dinners, customer meetups, roundtables, and so on. The guest list is usually a combination of existing customers and prospects.\u201d",
            "But obviously, the ",
            " has meant that customer advocacy teams need to change tack. \u201cIn a perfect world, customer advocacy is on the road about 60% of the time. We're either going in-person to customers, or we're creating these customer meetups or user conferences to bring them in to engage with us,\u201d says Bryant.",
            "The key is to still add a special element to add the VIP factor, even in the virtual world. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a virtual wine-tasting experience, which was a good antidote to a day of back-to-back Zoom calls. You can also do something like a chocolate tasting if you want to keep it alcohol-free,\u201d says Bryant.",
            "Segmentation is also a critical step. \u201cWhat\u2019s our audience and what topics do we want to tackle? Do we want to curate our invite list based on industry? Titles? We\u2019ve done e-commerce events, as well as CMO roundtables \u2014 you can come up with a slew of combinations.\u201d",
            "\u201cAs you go deeper from there, you get into the territory of executive programming \u2014 fostering relationships at the highest level and solidifying your shared commitment to a strong partnership between your companies,\u201d says Bryant. \u201cThis includes executive briefing centers and executive sponsorship programs \u2014 and in my experience, these are the most underutilized and the hardest to pull off.\u201d",
            "She digs into each one in more detail:",
            "\u201cThese pair your own executives with the top customers that you\u2019re looking to develop deeper relationships with. It usually makes sense when your business goals are to expand or develop better relationships with bigger brands,\u201d says Bryant. \u201cIf you ask an AE, \u2018What do you need to see a full wall-to-wall deployment?\u2019 and they respond that they have the director-level relationship, but they\u2019re lacking that VP-level champion, that\u2019s a good sign of an account where an executive sponsorship program would make a big difference.\u201d",
            "But there are some caveats. \u201cFirst of all, the pairings have to make sense and be authentic. You can\u2019t just automatically say, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re our COO, go talk to the COO on this account,\u2019\u201d says Bryant. \u201cSecond, I can\u2019t emphasize enough that this is about developing and deepening relationships for the long haul \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be seen as the latest quick-fix sales tactic. I\u2019m a broken record here, but that means making sure the customer or prospect gets something meaningful out of it. For example, maybe you can bring all of the accounts that are in your executive sponsorship program in for an end-of-year event, so they can network with each other. Maybe you can do a big survey or interview series, producing content that amplifies their own brands.\u201d",
            "Additionally, don\u2019t forget an important set of stakeholders here: your own executives. \u201cIt\u2019s typical to think of the VIP execs on your customers\u2019 side, but don\u2019t forget that you're working closely with your own C-suite. You don\u2019t want them to view these programs as a time suck,\u201d she says. Here are Bryant\u2019s two tips for maximizing the impact of your own execs:",
            ": \u201cGive each exec a list of the goals for each account, and share how much they\u2019ll have to engage. For example, expectations that they meet with the customer once or twice a month, just so they understand how much effort they\u2019ll be putting in.\u201d",
            ": \u201cWith every call that they take, the sponsor should be learning something too. Have them take notes if you can. They\u2019ll start to recognize patterns in customer pain points, and can bring that information back to their own departments.\u201d",
            "\u201cAn executive briefing center is a space for customers to come in and highlight what they need from the company or the product to be successful. From a customer advocacy side, that requires getting your own team ready \u2014 prepping your core leaders to showcase what you can offer, fine-tuning the presentation so it\u2019s customized to the customer\u2019s industry and needs, and getting a deeper understanding of what they're trying to accomplish within the next one to two years.\u201d",
            "A fair word of warning: \u201cWhen customers decide to engage with your executive briefing center, first off they've committed, and second, they've done some homework, so expect that they're going to come in with the tough questions.\u201d",
            "\u201cOnce the relationship is at the executive level, the partnership is usually at the stage where both companies benefit from working together and amplifying each other's brands \u2014 which is helpful because it seems like less of a \u2018favor\u2019 that the customer is doing on your behalf,\u201d says Bryant.",
            "This layer is very intentionally at the top of the customer advocacy pyramid. \u201cPeople often invert this, and start by asking to add the logo as soon as the contract ink dries, or requesting a case study cringingly soon,\u201d she says. \u201cBut with the pyramid approach, if a customer has hit every single program, then they're actually ready to be amplified. That\u2019s when I feel confident to send that over to the customer marketing team, and let them know that a VP or C-level executive from a bigger brand company would like to engage.\u201d",
            "Instead of looking at your account list and saying, \"Hey, we need a case study on this person,\u201d reverse the order of operations. Start with building a true relationship \u2014 the quotes and blog posts will be all the stronger for it.",
            "Every startup leader would likely agree that getting close to your customers, especially early on, is critical. But resources are scarce and other priorities can stack up. Here, Bryant makes the case for baking customer advocacy in from the start, and offers more lightweight tips for shoestring budgets.",

            ". But we often think of churn in terms of losing current revenue that we have to make up elsewhere in the immediate term. And with startups, that pressure is real, especially when you\u2019re in those make-it-or-break-it months when a customer failing to renew would have a devastating impact,\u201d says Bryant.\u00a0",
            "\u201cBut focusing on the additional expansion opportunities you could get from customers who ",
            " churn is an extra incentive. Creating those programs to build relationships will help you boost confidence that they\u2019re going to expand.\u201d",

            "Here are some red flags that indicate a customer advocacy-inspired approach might be missing at your startup:",
            ". \u201cMonitor your NPS and CSAT scoring closely. If they\u2019re starting to drop, you risk churn. There's some type of engagement that's needed, but not taking place.\u201d",
            "\u201cA common line of thinking is, \u2018We just need this amazing website,\u2019 or \u2018More logos will solve our problems.\u2019 But that process isn\u2019t easy. If your brand is feeling stale or it\u2019s slim pickings between what customer testimonials you can put up, that\u2019s a sign to consider advocacy.\u201d\u00a0",
            "\u201cAt my previous startup, we were really focused on how we were reflected on G2, because that came up in tons of sales conversations \u2014 \u2018Why should I go with you versus your competitor?\u2019 But when you don't feel confident to showcase where you stand or share any of those third-party reviews, those are risks.\u201d",
            "A fully built-out executive briefing center is likely not the best place to start. Here, Bryant offers tips tailored for the scrappy startup:",
            "\u201cAt a startup, you likely don\u2019t have the biggest budget to work with, and you\u2019re probably doing a million different things at once. In a nutshell, you need to gather a list of key customers, understand their needs, understand the company's immediate needs, and choose a specific program to focus on first,\u201d says Bryant.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWhat are the business goals? Increase engagement? Have better relationships with a certain segment of customers? I then look at all of my customers in tiers, creating three buckets that I want to focus on. Can you think of a program that will satisfy at least two of those business goals and benefit those customers you listed?\u201d she says.",
            "\u201cFor example, at one startup I worked at, we were under 250 employees and we had no engagement, no relationships \u2014 we didn't know how to get customers more involved. So I started off with designing our first customer meetup. I created a cocktail rooftop experience and found a senior leader that would want to do a fireside chat and actually talk about their career experience, not talk about the company or the product. I invited folks from my tiered list, and we actually had a great turnout, but it was a bit of a gamble at the time. After the event was a success, we had other leaders reach out who offered to do a similar fireside chat, and we were able to build from there.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe other benefit of focusing on just one program first is that you can get a baseline and see what actually worked. If you\u2019re trying tons of different things at once, it can be hard to see which experiment moved the needle, and make the clear-cut case to keep building customer advocacy programs,\u201d says Bryant.",
            "\u201cFor one of my early programs at a previous company, I launched our first third-party review campaign. And we went from zero to hundreds of reviews, so I knew we were making progress. But I didn't realize that the sales team was actually using that report to close multiple deals. That made requests for more resources easier \u2014 I could clearly show the founder that we were gaining new customers from advocacy programs.\u201d",
            "Small touches can make a big impact, even when there isn\u2019t a big budget to match. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to stand out. If you're hosting a roundtable and all your competitors are doing roundtables, then all your prospects are getting the same invitation. Why would that executive come to your round table versus the five other options they have?\u201d says Bryant.",
            "\u201cHow can you custom-tailor the event and showcase the customers who are showing up for you? For one of our events, guests received a bottle of alcohol engraved with their last name and we named one of the cocktails on the bar menu after the guest speaker. In my experience, executives notice these thoughtful details.\u201d",
            "It\u2019s also helpful to turn the budget constraint into a creative challenge. \u201cOften when my budget was smallest, that\u2019s when I was at my most creative. I\u2019ve launched a customer advisory board with a $5K budget and it was still very good,\u201d she says. This is also where building momentum is key. \u201cIf you\u2019re joining a startup as the first person in this type of role and they don\u2019t even really know what a CAB is, then asking for $10K right off the bat seems a little bizarre.\u201d",
            "\u201cOften there\u2019s pressure to show results immediately, to launch that CAB in a month. But you need to make sure you have the right people in the room \u2014 being wrong is very expensive, and not just in a dollar sense,\u201d says Bryant.\u00a0",
            "\u201cYou could be going after the wrong customers. You might not be sure what kind of feedback you\u2019re looking for yet. You might not have a developed-enough roadmap to even show them. You can waste time by moving too fast. Outlining the customers and business goals you\u2019re going after might take some time, but it sets the foundation for fast, creative experiments in the future.\u201d",
            "Without that marquee name recognition, getting customers and prospects to attend your events or volunteer their time seems like a herculean effort.",
            "\u201cAt one of my previous companies, we reached the point where we were in a good position to start a customer advisory board. Our goal was two-fold: First, to solidify our relationships so we can produce better reference calls, and second, to understand if our product was heading in the right direction,\u201d says Bryant.\u00a0",
            "\u201cThe CEO and I sat down and went through our customer list to see who would be a good fit. But it was a big time commitment, so we needed to figure out what we could offer in return. And coincidentally, we had just finished up a fundraise, so our founder had just been connecting with all of our investors. So we offered up intros to our investors and our network, in addition to the opportunity to influence our product \u2014 and we actually ended up with great participation.\u201d",
            "Can you offer up a network that your customers can't get anywhere else? That's what gets people to give you their time because many people can make money or generate branding opportunities, but they can't always get connections without the right introductions.",
            "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to create a series of one-off events. Can you make customers feel appreciated? Can you get their feedback to better inform your future programming?\u201d says Bryant.",
            "\u201cFor example, after our first virtual roundtable at a previous company, we sent a very detailed survey immediately. What did you like about the format? How frequently do you want to be engaged with us? Would you consider leading a future event? I learned that folks wanted more breakout sessions.\u201d",
            "Sending heartfelt thank yous is of course also important. \u201cFor VIPs, I always have my execs send out personalized notes to every customer who attended. It's a thoughtful, typed-out email highlighting some of the things that they talked about. Seeing that a senior leader is taking time out of their day, and not just sending a generic Marketo email can make a big impact,\u201d she says.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWhen I first started off in customer marketing years ago, I had to produce a customer newsletter, and success was about tracking opens and clicks. That doesn't work for me anymore,\u201d says Bryant. \u201cFor me, engagement is reflected in how many executives are showing up and having conversations with us, and how many customers have become actual partners. How many advocates are you adding a quarter? How much of revenue was influenced by a reference call?\u2019",
            "When I think about measuring the impact of advocacy, it's not about having a 60% open rate of a newsletter or an invitation. How many people actually show up to the programs that I've designed specifically for them?",
            "The key to starting off in a customer advocacy role on the right foot is to take a step back, Bryant says. \u201cAs a company\u2019s first head of customer advocacy, I came in understanding that this would be a blank canvas that I would have to create. I fell into a common trap, which is rushing in full speed and thinking, \u2018I\u2019m going to build our first customer advisory board,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to launch this new program.\u2019 But taking a step back, relying on my cross-functional allies, and getting a lay of the land was important,\u201d she says.\u00a0",
            "This is doubly true for those taking on this work at smaller startups. \u201cThey\u2019ve likely done a ton of experiments that you can learn from, and they might already have pieces of this customer advocacy work in place, just not under that specific title.\u201d",
            "A common mistake is trying to take on too much and launch everything overnight. Effective customer advocacy programs require thoughtfulness and strategic consideration. Take your time, trust your gut, and outline plans that work in parallel with business goals.",

            ". But because of the limitations of those studies, it wasn\u2019t clear how much transmission was happening and whether it happened everywhere to the same degree.",
            "This changed after Segata established his lab at the University of Trento in 2013. He and his team began to create and refine metagenomics tools that could distinguish between strains of the same species, which made it possible to study microbiome transmission in more detail.",
            "Segata started probing this question in 2018 by analyzing the microbes of mothers and their infants. His group\u2019s findings and several other studies confirmed earlier suspicions that there is a massive amount of transmission from mother to baby, such that the mother is \u201cimprinting the microbiome at birth,\u201d Segata said.

In follow-up experiments, the researchers largely ruled out the possibility that the new microbes came from the food people ate, because those microbes weren\u2019t able to colonize the gut very well.",

            "For the new global analysis of microbiomes, Segata, Valles-Colomer and their colleagues honed their tools enough to recognize previously unknown species and different strains of the same species. Using these tools, they examined more than 9,700 samples of stool and saliva from 20 countries on five continents, representing communities with very diverse lifestyles and covering the full range of the human life span and many different living arrangements. They traced more than 800,000 strains of microbes between families, roommates, neighbors and villages and calculated what percentage of shared species were the same strain.",
            "As they expected, they found that the most sharing of strains happened between mothers and infants in the first year of life \u2014 about 50% of the shared species found in the infants\u2019 guts were strains that spread from the mother. The mother\u2019s influence diminished with time \u2014 slipping from 27% at age 3 to 14% by age 30 \u2014 but didn\u2019t disappear. Some elderly people in China were shown to still share strains with their surviving centenarian mothers.",
            "The researchers Mireia Valles-Colomer and Nicola Segata of the University of Trento in Italy recently completed a massive analysis of human microbiome transmission around the world \u2014the most comprehensive such study ever performed.",

            "For ",
            ", an immunologist at the Mayo Clinic who was not involved in the study, one of the more surprising tidbits in the findings was that although infants born vaginally shared more strains with their mothers than infants born by C-section did, this difference vanished by three years of age. \u201cPeople make a big deal out of it\u201d that babies born via C-section might be more at risk for certain diseases, she said. But the findings suggest that maybe it \u201cshould not be a big thing.\u201d",
            "(That view was corroborated by ",
            " published this month in ",
            ". It found that babies born via C-section received less of their mother\u2019s microbiomes than babies born vaginally, but that they didn\u2019t miss out because they received more microbes from breast milk.)",
            "As we get older, a sizable portion of our microbiomes continues to come from the people we live with or near. Unsurprisingly, the study by Segata and colleagues found that spouses and other physically intimate partners shared a lot of microbes: 13% of the gut species they shared were of the same strain, as were 38% of their shared oral species.",
            "But people who lived together platonically weren\u2019t far behind, at 12% for shared gut species and 32% for shared oral species. That\u2019s because, as Segata, Valles-Colomer and their team found, the single most important determinant of transmission was time spent together. People living under one roof shared the most strains, but even people living in the same village tended to have more strains in common than people separated by greater distances. The frequency of strain sharing was consistent across different societies, but the team did confirm previous findings that people in non-westernized countries tend to have more diverse microbiomes.",
            "The researchers also found that strains held in common could be lost over time. Twins growing up together had about a 30% strain-sharing level that dropped to about 10% after 30 years of living apart.",
            "Segata thinks it\u2019s likely that most of the other strains of shared species also come from other people \u2014 primarily from close contacts like friends or co-workers, but maybe also from people we encounter far more briefly and casually. (Pets, however, are probably not big contributors: Segata said that animals mostly harbor microbial species that don\u2019t typically colonize or persist in us.)",
            "The findings are the strongest evidence to date that we share parts of our microbiomes with the people we spend the most time with. The fact that the authors were able to see this pattern of transmission across the globe, and not just in a single population, was \u201cstriking,\u201d said ",
            ", an associate professor in biomedical engineering at Cornell University. These data sets are extremely noisy, with many mutations happening across these different organisms, she added. But the team successfully uncovered \u201cthe signal across the noise.\u201d",
            "It\u2019s not clear how microbiome organisms spread between people. Kissing and sex explain some of it, but microbes could also be transmitted through droplets spewed by coughs and sneezes, or they could be picked up from contaminated surfaces. There\u2019s also still a lot to learn about which microbes are more easily spread than others. Answering that question is critical for understanding the implications of the idea that microbiome organisms can spread.",
            "Now that the extent of sharing has revealed the patterns of distribution of unique microbes, we can examine what happens in disease. \u201cIn that sense, I think this work is really fundamental,\u201d Clemente said.",

In December, Clancy wrote in her journal and confided in her husband about recurrent suicidal thoughts and, at least once, thoughts of harming her children.

Later that day, she built a snowman with two of her kids in the back yard of their home, in Duxbury, a suburb of Boston; she texted pictures to her husband. Toward dinnertime, Clancy called in a takeout order from a nearby restaurant. Her husband drove from their house to pick up the food and also stopped by CVS, at one point calling Clancy to double-check which brand of pediatric laxative she had asked him to purchase. He was gone for less than an hour. During that time, Clancy allegedly strangled her three children, ages five, three, and seven months, and then jumped from a top-floor window of the house, in an apparent suicide attempt. Clancy was arraigned on murder and assault charges from her Boston hospital bed on February 7th. Her attorney cited overmedication, postpartum depression, and the \u201cpossibility of postpartum psychosis\u201d as potential mitigating factors in her defense. (Some of the details of the events leading up to and on January 24th have been drawn from attorneys\u2019 statements during Clancy\u2019s arraignment.)",
            "The tragedy in Duxbury has drawn obsessive attention on Facebook, Reddit, TikTok, and elsewhere, sustained in part by Clancy\u2019s digital footprint, which includes endless photos of Clancy and her children smiling at the zoo, smiling at the beach, smiling in the pool. Some observers have shared their hopes that the case will raise awareness of perinatal and postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, or ",
            "s, which affect perhaps one in seven people who give birth. One of those disorders, known as postpartum psychosis\u2014what Clancy was possibly experiencing\u2014is rare, affecting one or two in a thousand women, at a conservative estimate. Filicide driven by postpartum psychosis is rarer still: the risk is maybe four per cent, although estimates are shaky.",
            "Postpartum psychosis tends to come on suddenly, often within four to six weeks of childbirth, around the time of weaning, or following a period of extreme sleep deprivation; it is sometimes presaged by anxiety and insomnia. A woman experiencing postpartum psychosis may show signs of mania, depression, or both; she may have aural hallucinations, paranoia, or delusions; she may stay awake day and night. She may, for stretches of time, appear to be perfectly normal.",
            "During the arraignment, the prosecuting attorney stressed that Clancy did not receive a ",
            " diagnosis when she was evaluated in Providence. But ",
            "s are significantly underdiagnosed, and often undertreated even when they have been recognized\u2014one estimate is that only around three per cent of women with postpartum depression are treated to remission. The prosecutor also emphasized evidence of Clancy\u2019s lucidity on the day of the killings: her voice did not sound \u201cslurred or impaired\u201d when she called the restaurant; when she texted her husband about her dinner order, she correctly spelled \u201cMediterranean Power Bowl.\u201d On social media, where an initial sympathy for Clancy has been largely overtaken by condemnation, these details are deployed as proof that she was sane when she killed her children. But clarity of speech and behavior alone does not rule out postpartum psychosis. \u201cOne of the hallmarks is that there\u2019s a waxing and waning of consciousness, confusion, and disorientation,\u201d Lauren M. Osborne, the vice-chair of clinical research in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Weill Cornell Medicine, told me. \u201cThe result is that people with postpartum psychosis may appear fine at one moment and not fine the next moment. It\u2019s that fluctuating course that\u2019s very distinct.\u201d",
            "Although ",
            "s have an obvious triggering event, their neurochemical byways are not well mapped. Researchers suspect a link to the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which surge during pregnancy and plunge after childbirth. Postpartum psychosis is especially mysterious, although it disproportionately affects people with bipolar disorder. Clare Dolman, who is a postdoctoral researcher at King\u2019s College London, received a bipolar diagnosis in early adulthood and took lithium to manage symptoms. She weaned off the drug before she became pregnant with her first child, with no adverse effects. \u201cSo I thought, I can breast-feed, because I\u2019ve had nine months or more where I\u2019ve been well,\u201d she told me. Soon, though, she began experiencing mania and hallucinations; after a six-week hospitalization, she recovered. A year later, when Dolman decided to try for another baby, she had a plan: \u201cI went back on lithium as soon as my son was born, I didn\u2019t breast-feed, and I had no problems,\u201d she said. For many women, however, postpartum psychosis is the first-ever presentation of bipolar traits; they lack what Dolman called \u201cthe experience and the insight to know that I was becoming ill.\u201d",
            "s may also correlate with certain immunological deficits, ",
            " and other inflammatory disorders, or gestational diabetes. But no one really knows. \u201cPostpartum psychosis has been around for thousands of years, and yet it is not an official disease category in the ",
            ",\u201d Veerle Bergink, the director of the Women\u2019s Mental Health Program at Mount Sinai, told me. \u201cThere is no money for it, not for research, not for treatment. There are no guidelines. This is one of the most severe conditions in psychiatry, one that has huge impacts on the mother and potentially on the child, and there\u2019s nothing.\u201d",
            "The presence of postpartum psychosis in medical literature reaches back to the Hippocratic Corpus, from the fifth or fourth centuries B.C., which described a new mother of twins who suffered delusions and sleeplessness. In \u201c",
            ",\u201d which appeared at the turn of the fifteenth century and is believed to be the first autobiography written in English, Kempe, a Christian mystic, portrayed her postpartum loss of reason as having brought her closer to Christ. In Victorian England, it was believed that \u201cpuerperal mania\u201d or \u201cinsanity of lactation\u201d could cause new mothers to imagine harming their infants, or even to act upon these thoughts. The French psychiatrist Louis-Victor Marc\u00e9 published the first substantive monograph on postpartum mental illness in 1858. \u201cWhere subjects are predisposed to mental illness through either hereditary antecedents, previous illnesses, or through an excessive nervous susceptibility,\u201d he wrote, \u201cpregnancy, delivery, and lactation can have disastrous repercussions.\u201d",
            "In the United Kingdom, owing to a law dating from the nineteen-twenties, a mother who kills her child generally receives a manslaughter charge leading to psychiatric treatment, in lieu of a murder conviction or prison time, if the baby is under the age of one and \u201cthe balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation.\u201d Upward of two dozen other countries have similar statutes; the United States does not. Currently, Illinois is the only state that provides for postpartum mental illness as a mitigating factor in sentencing.",
            "In roughly half of U.S. states, an insanity defense must conform to versions of the M\u2019Naghten Rule, which originated in mid-nineteenth-century England. According to M\u2019Naghten, a defendant must prove either that she didn\u2019t know what she was doing when she committed a crime or that she didn\u2019t know it was wrong. Michelle Oberman, a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law, told me, \u201cM\u2019Naghten is a standard that doesn\u2019t map onto most cases of maternal filicide\u201d involving postpartum psychosis, owing to its waxing-and-waning cadence. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult on a bunch of levels when someone is in and out of psychosis, because, when they\u2019re \u2018out,\u2019 there\u2019s a tendency to believe that they have the ability to control when they\u2019re \u2018in.\u2019 It starts to look more volitional, and volition is one of the key components of M\u2019Naghten.\u201d Oberman went on, \u201cThe legal system is predicated on a binary of sanity/insanity.\u201d",
            "Judges and juries often locate volition even when it seems beyond question that a defendant is psychiatrically disturbed. Kimberlynn Bola\u00f1os, a woman in Chicago, killed her five-month-old son, in 2013, in the belief that she was saving him from being kidnapped and tortured; her insanity defense faltered in part because she admitted to feeling regret during the act. In 2015, a California woman named Carol Coronado was found guilty of first-degree murder in the stabbing deaths of her three daughters, ages two, sixteen months, and three months, even though three psychiatrists and a psychologist attested that Coronado was suffering from postpartum psychosis. Andrea Yates, perhaps the most famous American case of postpartum psychosis and filicide, drowned her five children in their home, in suburban Houston, in 2001; she was convicted of capital murder despite a documented history of postpartum psychosis, postpartum depression, and suicide attempts. Two facts were presented as evidence that Yates, per M\u2019Naghten, comprehended that her actions were wrong: she waited\u2014as Clancy did\u2014for her husband to leave the house before killing the children, and she later called 911. (Yates\u2019s conviction was eventually overturned.)",
            "Both the legal and sociocultural responses to these cases, Oberman told me, tend to cleave to race and class lines. \u201cA necessary though often insufficient condition for an insanity defense may well be that you are wealthy enough to have a documented mental-health record: you talked to doctors about it\u2014you had the resources to seek treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cThis may be why most of the people who successfully exonerated themselves on grounds of postpartum psychosis have been white and affluent.\u201d",
            "One of these people was Angela Burling, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity at the 1984 manslaughter trial, in California, for the death of her nine-month-old son, Michael, her second child. Burling, who was married to a lobbyist for the California prison union, believed that her husband was the second coming of Christ and that Michael, whom she was weaning, was the devil. \u201cIt was an unravelling of my mind, but it felt real,\u201d Burling told me. \u201cEverything spoke to it: the radio, the television, seeing balloons for the grand opening of a new store\u2014I thought, Oh, they must be celebrating the second coming of Christ.\u201d She drowned Michael in a bathtub, convinced that her husband would raise him from the dead after three days. Prior to Michael\u2019s death, she said, there were few outward signs that she had entered postpartum psychosis. \u201cI was grocery shopping, feeding the children, giving them bottles, changing diapers, reading to them,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019d looked at me closely, you might have seen it in my eyes\u2014just dazed. My husband did say at one point that I seemed quiet.\u201d She can retrieve an image of the ordinary morning of her son\u2019s death: her husband leaving for work, \u201cand Michael had his Cheerios on his little tray.\u201d",
            "In our conversation, Burling said that her race and class undoubtedly boosted her legal defense, as did medical records showing that she had suffered a psychotic episode after the birth of her first child. Race and class also guide how much and what kind of attention these cases receive. In September, Erin Merdy, a Black woman in Brooklyn who was struggling with mental illness and facing eviction from her apartment, allegedly drowned her three children, ages seven, four, and three months. In November, Dimone Fleming, a Black woman in the Bronx who had reportedly become fixated on demonic possession, allegedly killed her sons, ages three and eleven months. In December, Paulesha Green-Pulliam, a Black woman in San Francisco who had recently lost a baby boy during childbirth, allegedly killed her daughters, ages five and one. All three women have been charged with murder. Unlike the Clancy case, none of these incidents became major national news or fodder for numerous lengthy Facebook and Reddit threads. The father of Merdy\u2019s eldest child, following his death, started a GoFundMe in his son\u2019s name; it raised about eight thousand dollars of its fifteen-thousand-dollar goal. The GoFundMe for Clancy\u2019s husband has raised more than a million dollars so far.",
            "It is not surprising that an upper-middle-class white woman who commits filicide would receive more attention than a poor Black woman who does the same; the imbalance is a variation on \u201c",
            ".\u201d But why do people fixate on these ghastly cases at all? Why does a single Facebook group devoted to discussion of the Clancy killings have nearly sixteen thousand members? It is more than mere fascination with the grisly and sensational; it is also, I think, a way of surfacing experiences that many of us\u2014in far milder ways\u2014share, and cannot otherwise talk about.",
            "In the middle of one night eight years ago, when my daughter was an infant, I was nursing her on our living-room sofa when a hulking blur loomed in the corner of my eye. I turned toward the nursery, adjacent to the living room, and saw, for a single billowing moment, a giant floating baby\u2014a kind of Mylar-balloon version of my own baby\u2014hovering in the doorframe. I knew it wasn\u2019t real, yet there it was. Two years later, in the middle of much the same night, swaying on the floor of the same nursery while holding my infant son, I felt a hard yet yielding pressure just below my shoulder blades, like the heel of a hand against my back. I thought I had bumped into the door to the room, which was ajar, but when I turned, the door was shut, and nowhere near me. A few nights later in that room, I sensed a hand on my shoulder that wasn\u2019t there. A ghost, or something like a ghost, was in the room with us. I felt this to be true, and I knew it was not true. To this day, I can be tidying up or folding laundry in that room and realize how accustomed I am to the possibility that I\u2019m not alone in it.",
            "I chalked up these episodes to extreme sleep deprivation, found them funny, and told a few friends about them. There was something that I did not tell my friends, that I never told anyone until I was researching this piece, and that I never even attempted to Google, because what if someone found it in my search history? When both of my children were infants, the same image flashed inside my eyes several times a day: that by some spasm or seizure or uncontrollable urge I would throw the baby against a wall. The image was blurry, monochrome, sped-up, a squiggly pencil animation that instantly erased itself. Outside of the flash, I felt no fear that I would actually hurt my child. But I was frightened and ashamed that my brain could produce such an image at all, and that it found the image so irresistible that it would keep cueing it up, like a catchy song or a cherished memory.",
            "These images are known as intrusive thoughts, and they are about as ordinary in the postpartum period as lack of ",
            " sleep or mastitis. The ",
            " of new mothers have unwanted thoughts about their infant being harmed, and around fifty per cent of postpartum people have thoughts of intentionally harming the baby themselves. (A nasty cousin to the intrusive thought is postpartum parasomnia, such as the \u201c",
            "\u201d waking nightmare, in which the half-awake mother searches frantically in the bedsheets for her lost infant.) \u201cIntrusive thoughts have a pretty sensible evolutionary function,\u201d Osborne told me. \u201c\u00a0\u2018My goal as a mother is to protect this vulnerable being. I need to be aware, at every moment, of any harm that can come to the child.\u2019 If you combine that with an American society that says that the mother is to blame for everything, then you have an evolutionary reason and a societal reason for people to have these thoughts.\u201d",
            "Wendy N. Davis, the executive director of the nonprofit Postpartum Support International, told me, \u201cWe're talking about a picture of fear, not an urge, and not a lack of skill. In fact, the parents who have these unwanted thoughts tend to be vigilant, highly attuned parents. They\u2019re not at risk of harming their children.\u201d Davis went on, \u201cI know a mom who scooched down the stairs on her butt for four months with the baby, because she kept seeing\u2014not ",

            " the baby go over the railing.\u201d",
            "Seriously depressed birthing people who have intrusive thoughts, Davis went on, are at a higher risk for suicidal ideation and suicide, \u201cbecause their brain is saying, \u2018This baby will be better off without me.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Intrusive thoughts can also interfere with what little sleep a new parent is getting. \u201cIf you have intrusive thoughts that your baby\u2019s going to die or something awful is going to happen, that may prompt you to check on the baby constantly, or make it hard for you to trust other people with your baby,\u201d Khatiya Moon, a reproductive psychiatrist at Northwell Health, told me. \u201cIt becomes exhausting and it feeds into that depression and anxiety that people may already feel.\u201d For mothers who are predisposed for the development of postpartum psychosis, Moon said, \u201cPoor sleep is a huge risk factor.\u201d",
            "I believe now that if I could have told someone about the intrusive thoughts, I would have had fewer intrusive thoughts. (Getting some sleep, a virtual impossibility during the first couple months of breastfeeding, also would have helped.) Putting words to the thoughts might have summoned the psychic garbagemen to clear the garbage out of my brain. But there are good reasons to say nothing.

            "Why would a psychiatrist or an ob-gyn physician or nurse call the police to report a patient for their thoughts? Part of the answer might be found in the void between psychiatry and obstetrics. \u201cTraining about reproductive psychiatry is not required in psychiatry-residency training\u2014you can graduate knowing zip about reproduction,\u201d Osborne said. Likewise, ob-gyn residents are not required to receive training in initiating treatment for a patient\u2019s anxiety or depression. In 2019, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that pediatricians screen birthing parents for ",
            "s at the one-, two-, four-, and six-month well-baby visits; a 2019 survey showed that only about half of pediatricians were doing so. \u201cSome pediatricians say, \u2018I\u2019m not the mom\u2019s doctor; I\u2019m the baby\u2019s doctor,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Osborne said.",
            "The intrusive thoughts that I experienced have little to do with the delusions and disassociation native to postpartum psychosis. As disturbing as the thoughts were to me, they likely wouldn\u2019t have met a threshold for diagnosis of postpartum anxiety or depression. The paradox of intrusive thoughts is that they are at once taboo and utterly banal. This is a great clue, I think, to why Lindsay Clancy\u2019s case has attracted such unrelenting attention on social media. Most of the commenters on Facebook and Reddit appear to be mothers; it follows, then, that half or more of them have had intrusive thoughts that they didn\u2019t act upon. They likely don\u2019t know, just as I didn\u2019t, that it is common and normal for the hormonally askew and sleep-starved postpartum brain to crank up a projector full of cautionary horrors, just as it is extraordinarily uncommon and abnormal for the brain to generate a wholly different kind of horror and to interpret it as a command. The juxtaposition of the unspoken and the unspeakable is why so many people cannot look away, even if they want to. Lindsay Clancy is the intrusive thought.",
            "Postpartum psychosis and other postpartum mood disorders tend only to earn serious media investigation when the death of a child is involved. But the greatest physical and psychological risk posed by these maladies, of course, is to the mother.

I was so happy whenever she brought me out of my shell, and I was sure that she would do that as a mother\u2014to be goofy, to encourage our child to be himself, to embrace embarrassment.\u201d He knew that Liz, who worked in the publishing industry, would pass on her love of reading and storytelling to their child, whom they named Owen. She would teach him to write plays and poems. From Liz, Owen would learn friendship and socializing; he would inherit her emotional intelligence; he would learn the art of being goofy.",

Within a few weeks of Owen\u2019s birth, Brian told me, Liz had become detached and emotionless. (I am withholding their last names.) Brian said, \u201cShe had a warmth and empathy that could bring those things out in me\u2014I didn\u2019t necessarily have as much of that when I met her. She made everybody feel like they mattered, and she really believed that they did. She approached life with joy, and all of a sudden the joy was missing.\u201d He told me that Liz struggled with breastfeeding and did not sleep. \u201cShe had an unstable hold on reality,\u201d he said. \u201cShe told me that she felt like she wasn\u2019t in reality but was just watching it from far away, with no feelings.\u201d At times, according to Brian, this sense of alienation intermixed with feelings of guilt and failure as a mother. \u201cShe was unable to pull out of spirals of self-doubt,\u201d he said.",
            "About two months after Owen\u2019s birth, Liz attempted suicide. She then spent about two weeks in a psychiatric ward. By that point, Liz had a diagnosis of postpartum depression, and was being treated with Zoloft, the antidepressant, and Abilify, a mood stabilizer commonly prescribed for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. \u201cIt was pretty clear that it was a revolving-door situation there with the patients,\u201d Brian said. \u201cThe doctors were, like, \u2018We are looking for drugs to solve this problem. We can\u2019t even begin to get to the bottom of someone\u2019s feelings\u2014we are just trying to regulate here.\u2019 That was my understanding of their approach.\u201d Brian was making calls and doing research, trying to come up with an outpatient plan for Liz. The crowded psych ward \u201cwasn\u2019t an environment that was conducive to feeling better, and it continued the detachment because she was away from Owen,\u201d Brian said.",

She was admitted to a psychiatric hospital upstate, where she received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. \u201cThe doctors said that pregnancy turned the switch on,\u201d Brian said. Liz began taking lithium, a mood stabilizer commonly prescribed for bipolar disorder, and Zyprexa, an antipsychotic medication. As long as Liz was in the upstate hospital, Brian could rest assured that she was safe, and he could focus on caring for Owen.

On the recommendation of her medical team, she was spending incrementally more time on her own at home. One morning, Brian and Liz dropped off Owen at day care together; Brian continued on to work and Liz returned to their apartment. \u201cThat\u2019s when it ended up happening,\u201d Brian said. Liz took an overdose of over-the-counter sleep medication and died days later.",

I had talked with her on Zoom a few days before I first met Brian. On a June day ten years ago, van den Eijnden woke up earlier than usual. She dressed her two-year-old son, four-month-old daughter, and herself. Later that day, she asked her husband and kids to stay on their living-room couch, because \u201cdangers\u201d had sprung up on the other side of the house\u2014a swamp, a magical well. Her husband called a general practitioner, who came to their house and called a crisis line; the crisis service in turn called a psychiatrist to the home.

I thought I was in a museum in Berlin. I was speaking French. I thought I was hooked up to other people with threads everywhere, like in \u2018The Matrix.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Van den Eijnden responded poorly both to sleep medication and to antipsychotic drugs. Because she wandered at night, doctors moved her to a more secure isolation room; her husband took over caring for their baby, using paid leave. Hospital workers later found van den Eijnden attempting to breastfeed a pillow.",
            "She spent around eight weeks in the lockdown ward, moving between psychotic and catatonic episodes, and eventually recovered with the help of electroconvulsive therapy. After about three months in the hospital, van den Eijnden received nine months of outpatient treatment. She received home visits from a social worker to help her reacclimate to running a household\u2014assistance with to-do lists, laundry, and the like. She also tapered off lithium, under a doctor\u2019s supervision.",

They gathered in a meeting room in the mother-infant unit, with its mild beige-and-yellow color scheme, play mat, and changing table. Her husband came in with their baby on one arm and their toddler holding his other hand. It took van den Eijnden a few moments to understand that these kids were her kids, that she was their mother. \u201cIt was as if I was seeing them for the first time,\u201d she said. \u201cI was amazed by how beautiful these children were.\u201d\u00a0\u2666",

First, Cook could announce his resignation tomorrow and his legacy is gold: he guided the company past Steve Jobs\u2019s tragic, far-too-young death; the company\u2019s market cap has increased nearly ten-fold under his leadership; he oversaw the construction and opening of Apple Park; he turned Apple into a services juggernaut in addition to maintaining its position as the most profitable hardware company in the world; and product-wise, under his leadership Apple has launched Apple Watch (the most popular and profitable watch and fitness tracker in the world), AirPods (the most popular and profitable augmented reality devices in the world), and overtaken Intel as the premiere silicon design company in the world. Nor does it seem like he\u2019s going anywhere soon. Furthermore, even without the above litany of accomplishments over the last decade, Tim Cook just does not seem ego driven in the least.
