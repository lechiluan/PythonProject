All macro-nutrients are important in order to see gains but the most important one for muscle growth is protein. Muscles are made out of protein, so when we put our muscles under stress small fissures appear on them. Those micro-fissures are the starting points of muscle growth, our body will then use it stored protein to repair those fissures, muscle growth is a byproduct of this process, after those fissures are repaired, the muscle will be stronger than it was before. So making sure we have enough protein for our body to repair our muscles is extremely important!",
            "Okay, how do we know how much protein we need? Well, you just need to do some math to know the amount of protein: 1.25 (sedentary) to 2.1 (weightlifting) x body-weight = protein intake.\nOkay simple enough! But then we need to know the eating windows, the\nprotein ingestion time, the number of calories necessary for a bulk or a fast, then we also need to take into account the amount of macro-nutrients we need.",
            "We need to track all of this information and make sure we don't forget it, plus all of this information changes dynamically with the person body, if the person is losing weight every calculation changes accordingly... So we never have a moment of respite. This is truly more than a physical sport, it is also a mental one, one where planning and organizing is extremely important in order to see improvements and to have as much control in sculpting our own body, thus we must use our mind if we want to perform well and not stagnate.",

            "To understand the sweep of the problem, it is necessary to dive into the leviathan that is San Francisco\u2019s city government. It took me several months of interviews with developers, commissioners, housing advocates and academics to fully understand the bottleneck of bureaucracy surrounding housing: a compounding set of confounding procedures that necessitates securing at least 87 permits, enduring 1,000 days for meetings and paying more than\u00a0 $500,000 in fees on average for any residential project. In combination, these procedures make nearly all housing projects financially infeasible to build in San Francisco.",
            "Any attempt to build housing in San Francisco starts with meetings. Lots of meetings. Of course the San Francisco Planning Department will want to have its say. So will the Mayor\u2019s Office of Disability and the Fire Department \u2014 among others.",
            "There are two phases of housing development. The first is the project approval \u2014 or entitlement \u2014 phase. This requires meeting with the San Francisco Planning Department to prepare application forms simply requesting permission to build. In San Francisco, housing projects face a median wait time of\u00a0more than 450 days for this entitlement.",
            "The second phase is called the building permit \u2014 or post-entitlement \u2014 phase. This is when developers apply for permits to build. Combined with the project approval stage, the time to complete permitting often stretches to over three years, according to data published in San Francisco\u2019s housing element. That\u2019s more than 1,000 days before a housing project can even begin construction.",
            "To understand the bottlenecks, let\u2019s break down the process.",
            "It can take 600 days to finish approvals for housing\u00a0in San Francisco.",
            "There are six phases to housing development in San Francisco:",
            "Steps 1 and 2 involve preliminary project assessments (which take 60 days) and project application filings (about 30 days) to the Planning Department that detail the overall housing project.",
            "Steps 3 and 4 entail the preliminary application review (which takes about 90 days) where the Planning Department conducts checks of residential, streets and urban design planning, followed by any project refinements (typically another 30 days).",
            "Step 5 is the final project analysis where comprehensive plan and design checks, and environmental reviews are conducted (which can take at least 180 days).",
            "Finally, Step 6 is where after receiving an official project approval, the developer can apply for building permits to begin construction (but it can take over 600 days).",
            "Why does navigating these steps take so long?",
            "In part because San Francisco is the only major city in California with a city charter that mandates that all permits are \u201cdiscretionary\u201d and, by consequence, appealable. This simple rule has far-reaching consequences.",
            "\u201cIn most cities, building permits follow what is called \u2018ministerial\u2019 approval \u2014 where if a project is code compliant, the permits will be approved, often in months,\u201d said Rachael Tanner, president of the San Francisco Planning Commission. \u201cThe issue in San Francisco is that because all permits are discretionary, a governing body like the Board of Supervisors can weigh in \u2014 or a single resident can ask for the Planning Commission or for the Board of Appeals to take a closer look. This can literally add years to even the simplest projects.\u201d",
            "San Francisco\u2019s discretionary process allows for two obstructionist tactics.",
            "The first is that it enables a neighborhood organization or a single person to file a notice to the Planning Department requesting a delay of the project during the project approval stage or to file a notice to the Board of Appeals at the building permit stage.",
            "CEQA appeals can add more time to building housing in San Francisco",
            "The recent housing project at 870 Union St. is a case study that is part of ",
            ". A preliminary project assessment was filed in October 2015. Less than a year later, the project filed and received approval for most of its paperwork. But in September 2016, an appeal was filed by a neighborhood resident, triggering hearings and further meetings with the Planning Commission. The project wasn\u2019t approved until May 2017 \u2014 more than 200 days later.",
            "San Francisco abounds with such examples of projects delayed by neighborhood input. The cumulative impact was a 123-day median delay in the housing approval process in 2021, according to ",
            ".",
            "San Francisco is also the only city in California that allows such building permit appeals even after a project has received all its approvals. ",
            " which would ban this practice. But even if that ban is implemented, a second obstructionist tactic still emerges from San Francisco\u2019s discretionary system \u2014 a delay induced by the California Environmental Quality Act.",
            "A well-intentioned 1970 law, known as CEQA, initiates a process requiring technical studies, environmental notices and additional hearings to evaluate and disclose to the public the environmental impact of any discretionary action by local government. Thanks to San Francisco\u2019s charter, that includes housing projects. Housing experts note that the sheer volume of studies and meetings required to even consider a CEQA filing results in a median 122-day delay to projects. And if deemed necessary, an actual environmental impact report can take a median of 700 days to complete, according to ",
            ".",
            "In essence, because all permits in San Francisco are discretionary, every housing project becomes a political battle.",
            "This is what happened at 469 Stevenson St., where developers sought to build 495 units of housing on a Nordstrom valet parking lot, only to be delayed more than a year when the Board of Supervisors rejected the project\u2019s environmental analysis for what many critics argued were spurious reasons.",
            "San Francisco\u2019s extensively broad application of CEQA necessitates conducting more than 5,000 reviews per year. This intensive level of environmental review is not cheap. According to the ",
            ", around 40 full-time planners are employed just to work on these reviews.",
            "It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.",
            "San Francisco can simply follow the example of cities like San Jose, Mountain View and Santa Clara, which employ a split permitting process.\u00a0",
            "In this split process, the planning approval is discretionary while building permit approval is ministerial. This streamlines the approval process and avoids unnecessary discretionary stopgaps.",
            "\u201cBifurcating the planning and building permit process will create a clear and discernible path for applicants to see what is required of their project,\u201d says Raquel Bito, president of San Francisco\u2019s Building Inspection Commission.",
            "Indeed, the Department of Building Inspection formally first reviewed such a proposal in August \u2014\u00a0 and is now investigating mechanisms to streamline.",
            "We actually can see the potential impact of ministerial approval in place today. In 2017, a bill authored by state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, SB35, was signed into law and it\u00a0enabled ministerial approval at both the project approval and building permit stages for projects that feature 50% or more affordable housing.",
            "The 555 Bryant St. housing development in San Francisco benefited from SB35 \u2014 a preliminary project application was filed in January 2021 and the project ",
            " \u2014 roughly half the time of the 870 Union St. project.",
            "\u201cMinisterial approval isn\u2019t just important, it\u2019s an absolutely essential tool if San Francisco is to meet its goal of building 82,000 homes in the next eight years,\u201d said ",
            ", which would renew SB35 and make it\u00a0even more effective.",
            "The solution here is clear \u2014 build by ministerial approval. It works, even sometimes in San Francisco.",
            "Just because a housing project is approved doesn\u2019t workers can start building. It merely means the project has permission to apply for permits to start building.",
            "In San Francisco, that process ",
            ". Worse yet, 270 projects during the past 10 years have taken more than four years to get all their permits. This is the slowest approval time for permits in any major city in California. It\u2019s 400 days longer than Oakland and 300 days longer than Berkeley.",
            "Where\u2019s the breakdown?",
            "The issue is bureaucracy. Namely, the 87 permits San Francisco\u2019s housing element identified that a project needs to apply for in order to begin development: 15 permits from the Planning Commission, 26 permits from the Public Utilities Commission and Fire Department, 19 permits from the Department of Building Inspection, 17 permits from the Public Works and 10 other permits related to public spaces.",
            "With 87 permits across multiple departments, it\u2019s easy to see how San Francisco\u2019s bureaucracy is slowing housing development to a crawl.",
            "Why does San Francisco require so many permits? Part of the problem is redundancy. Of the 87 permits listed, at least 12 pertain to issues of water regulations, issued separately by the Public Utilities Commission, Department of Building Inspection and Public Works.",
            "And it isn\u2019t just the sheer number of permits. San Francisco forces developers to receive each set of permits sequentially \u2014 you can apply for a set of permits only after you have completed the previous set. With 87 permits, the time compounds.",
            "Compare that to San Jose, which has ",
            " of both the planning and permitting phases. According to\u00a0Bito, this allows builders to receive feedback more readily from all requisite departments (like Public Works and the Fire Department), potentially shaving months of waiting.",
            "Permitting in San Francisco isn\u2019t just time-consuming, though, it\u2019s expensive.",
            "Permitting fees \u2014 specifically, what the Department of Building Inspection charges for a housing project \u2014 are proportional to the cost of construction. The challenge here is the unpredictability of those costs.",
            "Labor and material prices are constantly changing. The longer a project is delayed in the approval or building permit phases, the higher likelihood that market conditions change and materials costs have risen, and the higher the city\u2019s fees.",
            "Furthermore, during the time developers are applying for permits, they incur significant costs to hold the land they plan to use.",
            "San Francisco\u2019s development process is also loaded with what are called \u201cimpact fees\u201d \u2014 or fixed fees to get project approval. These impact fees cover the cost of providing public services like schools, water, transportation and public art investments in a neighborhood. But when added to the litany of other direct and indirect costs San Francisco imposes on development, they can make projects infeasible.",
            "All told, housing development projects over $25 million can in turn incur at least $500,000 in combined impact and permitting fees, according to San Francisco\u2019s Housing Element. This can add up to $74,000 in costs to an individual apartment or condo in San Francisco, ",
            ", $54,000 per unit in Emeryville and\u00a0$62,000 per unit in San Jose.",
            "The result of these astronomical costs in San Francisco makes housing projects risky or infeasible to build. Only the most monied developers, therefore, have access to the market \u2014 and they focus on expensive high-rises to improve the odds of recouping their investments.",
            "If a housing project has to sequentially wade through 87 permits, pay $500,000 in impact and permitting fees and endure 1,000 days of meetings simply to break ground, it will be a tall order for San Francisco to build 10,000 houses per year as stated in our state-mandated housing element. We can\u2019t even build 2,000 a year today.",
            "It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We can be a city with abundant, affordable housing, where unhoused populations can find stable homes, where San Francisco\u2019s workers can live near their jobs, and where people and families of all stripes can make this city their home.",
            "To move forward, however, we need to radically reform our housing approval processes. We need to transition housing approvals away from discretionary reviews \u2014 like every other major city in California.",
            "State legislation like Assembly Member Haney\u2019s AB1114 and state Sen. Wiener\u2019s SB423 are necessary steps to get us there. But they are insufficient on their own.",
            "San Francisco also needs to streamline permitting to allow for parallel processing and a reduction in impact fees. This is largely in the domain of Mayor Breed\u2019s office, and executive action here is necessary. Her ",
            "which requests that all departments streamline permitting by 50% within a year, is a great step in the right direction.",
            "But setting broad goals is just a start. San Francisco needs decisive action.",

            "), but on the older and now often-dismissed Generative Adversarial Network (",
            ") model.",
            "Prior works with similar scope have always been trained on limited datasets, while the new system, titled GigaGAN, has been trained on subsets of the hyperscale LAION dataset that powers Stable Diffusion.",
            "Until now, GAN networks tended to become unstable when training very high volumes of data, but the researchers for the new project have used multiple adjunct and additional technologies to bolster and reinforce a StyleGAN-based architecture so that GigaGAN can not only produce fine quality text-to-image photos in a fraction of the time that latent diffusion models (LDMs) take, but also produce images at extraordinarily high resolutions by default (rather than on the greatest and most powerful GPUs).",
            "The latter achievement has been enabled by a novel upscaling architecture, which is capable of producing high-resolution detail, and which, the authors state, can also be dropped into other generative systems \u2013 even those that do not use GANs, such as DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion.",
            "The multi-scale training used for GigaGAN, combined with some palliative tricks to overcome GAN\u2019s traditional scaling issues, several borrowed from diffusion-based architectures, has enabled a 1-billion parameter GAN based on LAION, which natively produces \u2018immediate\u2019 images, instead of trawling through a denoising process that\u2019s more or less tied to available GPU resources, but which carries innate high latency, in systems such as Stable Diffusion.",
            "The authors concede that while many of the results are impressive, many are also of a lower perceptual standard than can be achieved with DALL-E 2. However, the same could be said of Stable Diffusion itself, whose massive popularity is attributable more to its widespread availability than to any visual superiority to OpenAI\u2019s more restricted framework.",
            "The researchers claim that GigaGAN offers three major advantages over diffusion and autoregressive models:",
            "Prompt-mixing in Stable Diffusion is currently a problematic pursuit, since one part of the prompt tends to dominate, and most of the solutions offered by the research sector come with caveats.

            "In the fast-moving image synthesis sector, the core functionality here is well-established, and, perhaps until now, has even been considered a little \u2018archival\u2019. Here, the input image is mapped into a style vector, which feeds the processed information into a series of ",
            " convolutional layers. This generates a constant ",
            " (basically an array of values, like a crossword grid) that will be used to influence the final image through the various upsampling processes.",
            "What\u2019s different is that GigaGAN adds a ",
            " (SAKS, right, in the image above). This module has been designed expressly to allow a StyleGAN-based system to process data at the kind of scale that\u2019s more common in latent diffusion systems.",
            "The SAKS creates a bank of filters, instead of just a single filter, each of which handles a processed ",
            " at each layer. Subsequently, the processed data passes through a ",
            " (or ",
            " layer), and predicts a group of ",
            " to average across all the newly-created filters.",
            "This produces, finally, a single aggregated filter, which will then be passed into the more familiar processes of StyleGAN2.",
            "The authors note that at the schema level, this ",
            "-based weighting effectively constitutes a differentiable filter selection process that\u2019s specific to the input (i.e., the varying text/image data that\u2019s in play during the generation process).",
            "The authors further observe:",
            "These innovations alone cannot adapt GANs to the task at hand, however. Therefore the researchers have integrated additional attention layers directly into the convolutional architecture at the core of StyleGAN2, and have also used ",

            " game.",
            "In contrast to the original design of StyleGAN, GigaGAN uses both the text-based style code to orchestrate the synthesis framework, and the word-embeddings, which are used as fodder for the cross-attention mechanisms.",
            "For the generator, text embeddings are extracted from the user-supplied text prompt (i.e., ",
            ") and the extracted tokens passed through a frozen ",
            "-based feature extractor. CLIP maintains the relationship between the derived semantic concepts and their associated images, which are originally trained into a multimodal model (traditionally, a latent diffusion model).",
            "The discriminator is split into varying branches that deal with text and images. Additional discernment functions are provided by CLIP and from vision-aided GAN training, a ",
            " developed by Carnegie Mellon and Adobe in 2022.",
            "For this stage, the CLIP model effectively acts as a central backbone extracting features from the incoming intermediate layers, and passing them through further discriminating layers which make predictions as to the \u2018authenticity\u2019 of the generated images. As per usual, with GANs, these predictions are systematically used to let the generator know how well it performed this time.",
            "The GAN-based upsampler baked into the architecture is a discrete architecture that, the authors state, can potentially be leveraged in other systems.",
            "Many of the recent breed of diffusion-based image synthesis models, such as PARTI, feature multi-level upsampling, where the generated material (still in ",
            " form) is passed through successive enlargement layers until it reaches the desired output resolution, at which point the latent codes are translated into an actual image.",
            "This is like ",
            " in reverse, in that the image, at least in theory, should be actively improving at each stage of upscaling. Since the image information is still in vector form (i.e., it\u2019s mathematical, and not yet a rendered bunch of pixels), none of the usual degradation that comes with generational copying are in force, and each upscaling layer will add detail related to the semantic terms (i.e., lizard [skin], etc.).",
            "The authors note that this process is different to traditional upsampling, in that the text prompt or related word embeddings will be considered as input factors affecting the result of the enlargement.",
            "GigaGAN\u2019s upsampler is an asymmetric U-Net which processes the initial 64px resolution images, before passing them on to a formidable six further upscaling layers, finally arriving at the 512px resolution. This process can be concatenated and extended to enable much higher resolutions.",
            "The paper observes that the upsampler does not use the aforementioned Vision-Aided GAN, but applies a small amount of Gaussian noise between layers. Adding this noise \u2018generalizes\u2019 each upsampled image, reducing the perceptual gap between real and generated images.",
            "Here the authors observe:",
            "The superresolution upscaling model in GigaGAN is trained on the same material as the base model, and is systematically compared with the ",

            " to pop the connection pointer off the stack.",
            "As these requests begin to queue, problems arise such as slow user experience or wasted compute resources due to saturated services.",

            " which speeds up TCP while also establishing SYN cookies. TFO was originally presented by Google in 2011 ",
            " and is now the default implementation for opening sockets in the kernel.",
            "If the network stack receives requests at a faster rate than the workers can process the requests, the accept queue grows.",
            "In the follow model, a worker is any arbitrary service that communicates with the networking stack using ",

            " to begin accepting inbound connections.",
            "For example a ",

            " and later calls ",
            " passing each connection off to a new goroutine.",

            "Despite this analysis being exciting from a conceptual perspective to any engineer hoping to operate a web server without finding their service vulnerable to a denial of service attack.\nThe implications on the accept queue and performance are even more exciting to understand.",
            "On a discreet compute system, the longer an inbound request sits in an accept queue with idle system resources, the less performant your server implementation is.\nIn other words the more accept queuing that can be observed without simultaneously correlating CPU utilization also at capacity, the more time your computers are sitting around doing nothing when they could otherwise be processing traffic.",

            "In my opinion it is important to measuring queues when an element is added, as well as removed from the queue.\nThis ensures accurate reporting to the total lifecycle of a given accumulation period such that an element can not be added or removed silently.",
            "This methodology of measuring when an element is added, and removed is important because kprobes are executed inline with existing kernel functions.\nIn other words, the only way to surfacing the values out of the kernel with kprobes is for something to actually exercise the code that adds and removes elements from the queue.",

            "They take deposits from people like us and pay us a low rate of interest. And lend most of these deposits out to others and earn a higher rate of interest. In the process, they make a decent chunk of money. They also invest some of the money into things like bonds. It may not earn much money but they can sell these quickly in case of an emergency. And of course, they keep a bit aside in cash. To be on the safe side.",
            "Or at least that\u2019s how it should work.",
            "In reality, it\u2019s not so simple. A lot of things could go wrong. Banks could make really poor lending decisions. And people don\u2019t return the money. Or the bank might even make some bad investment decisions. They\u2019ll invest money in complex things they don\u2019t understand.",
            "The economy will get into a rut. And the problems at the bank will become public news. Depositors could panic. There might be a run on the bank. This means people rush to withdraw whatever money they deposited. They lose trust. And eventually, the bank could collapse.",
            "Suddenly, the bank is not boring anymore.",
            "Which brings us to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. The fabled banker to startups that has been around since 1983.",
            "Now being around for so many years means that SVB\u2019s quite the experienced player. It has seen its share of bad markets\u200a\u2014\u200athe dotcom crash, the great financial crisis, the coronavirus pandemic. Everything.",
            "But\u20262023 was different. SVB was hit by a perfect storm.",
            "Let us explain. See, immediately after the pandemic, the US central bank slashed interest rates to all-time lows. To nearly zero. They wanted to entice people to borrow money and spend. Propel the economy.",
            "Startups benefited greatly from this too. All this easy money meant that Venture Capital money rushed into startups by the boatload. Investors often didn\u2019t even care about business models. They just wanted fancy stories. And while a lot of money was burnt at the altar of growth, these startups parked millions of dollars they\u2019d raised with banks too. Naturally, since SVB was a startup darling, it got a lot of these deposits. Between 2020 and 2022, SVB\u2019s deposits soared 3 times\u200a\u2014\u200afrom $62 billion to $190 billion.",
            "Now as we said, SVB could do two things with this money. Lend it out or invest it.",
            "But startups weren\u2019t asking for loans. They didn\u2019t need it because VC money was abundant. So,",
            "while the deposits tripled, loans only doubled. SVB was left with a lot of spare cash. They decided to invest it.",
            "Now, if you\u2019re a sensible and prudent bank, you\u2019d just take that money and invest it somewhere ultrasafe. Such as a short-term government bond. That\u2019s the safest bet there is. You might earn peanuts. Say 0.25% interest. But you\u2019re a bank. Safety first is the motto!",
            "The thinking is that if companies suddenly wake up and demand their money back, you can quickly sell these government bonds. There will be plenty of buyers waiting to lap them up. Everyone\u2019s happy. Everything\u2019s safe.",
            "But, SVB messed up. They got a bit greedy. Or stupid?",
            "Out of the roughly $115 billion they invested, nearly $80 billion was into things that would make them even more money\u200a\u2014\u200agive them interest of 2% and make their profits look fabulous. But here\u2019s the thing about the world of finance\u200a\u2014\u200aif you try to earn higher returns, it comes packaged with more risk. In SVB\u2019s case, this risk was that most of these investments were made in long-term bonds. Things such as real estate securities",
            "Now here\u2019s the thing you need to understand. All those monies the startups deposited were SVB\u2019s liabilities. The startups could demand it whenever they wanted. At least most of it. And that made these liabilities short-term in nature.",
            "On the other hand, the SVB\u2019s investments are its assets. Now it doesn\u2019t take a genius to tell you that if liabilities are short-term in nature, its assets also better be short-term in nature. You should be able to sell the assets quickly without losing money on it. And long-term real estate securities don\u2019t quite meet that definition.",
            "It\u2019s what the pros call a classic case of asset-liability mismatch. To be fair, most banks do some version of this. But SVB was, let\u2019s say, less balanced in its approach than others.",
            "Now there\u2019s one more problem. See, bonds are wired a little differently.",
            "For starters, the price of a bond and its yield\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is another word for returns\u200a\u2014\u200amove in opposite directions. The reason is actually simple. Imagine you pay $100 and buy a bond. And you get 2% interest or a yield on it. Then, the central bank raises interest rates. Suddenly, your bond is not attractive anymore. So you decide to sell it. Others who own the bond sell it too. Now you know that when people sell, the price takes a knock. And let\u2019s say that the price of the bond falls to $99. Suddenly, investors realize that the bond is available at a discount of 1%. So if they buy it now, they\u2019ll benefit from the discount and also get the 2% interest. Basically, as the price falls, the overall yield rises. And vice versa.",
            "But what\u2019s weirder is that a long-term bond is more sensitive to this inverse relationship. When the interest rate rises, its price falls. By a lot.",
            "And this brings us to the perfect storm we told you about.",
            "Just look back at what happened last year. The US Federal Reserve finally raised interest rates. And it raised rates quite quickly. If you\u2019ve followed our explanation, you\u2019ll know by now that it\u2019s not a good scenario for long-term bonds. The prices of SVB\u2019s assets fell significantly. The bank was looking at losses on its books.",
            "In a normal environment, SVB could\u2019ve held on to these bonds. Waited for them to mature and got all their money back. Because this wasn\u2019t a case of default. It was just some market volatility.",
            "But\u2026the past 12 months haven\u2019t really been what you\u2019d call normal. The startup world turned upside down. When interest rates shot up, VCs turned off the funding tap too. They started asking the hard questions\u200a\u2014\u200aabout profits. Startups couldn\u2019t raise more money. And in order to keep the business running, they needed to get their hands on money. So they asked for their deposits from SVB. They began making withdrawals.",
            "And at one point, SVB had no option but to sell its investments to make these payouts. But, because interest rates had gone up, these real estate bonds lost their value. SVB made significant losses.",
            "Now, this wasn\u2019t the end of the world for SVB. The bank actually had enough money to tide over this loss.",
            "But\u2026it had to follow the rules of the banking world. And the rules dictated that SVB needed to beef up its capital a bit because of the loss. It needed to issue shares and raise money. So it made that announcement. It told the world about its plan.",
            "And that\u2019s when everything unravelled.",
            "Because unfortunately for SVB, something else happened at the exact same time. The day it announced its plan to clean up the balance sheet, ",
            "\u200a\u2014\u200aa banker to crypto firms\u200a\u2014\u200aimploded too. It was the exact same playbook. It committed the same mistakes as SVB.",
            "And when Silvergate collapsed, it spooked the startups which banked with SVB. Word spread quickly within tech circles that trouble was brewing. And VC firms tweeted, sent memos, had conference calls, and told their investee companies to pull out money from SVB too. The trickle of outflows turned into a flood.",
            "And even though SVB\u2019s ",
            " to stay calm, it didn\u2019t help. The damage was done. At the end of the day, the same startups that SVB helped for the past many years turned their back on it.",
            "The US regulator had to step in. It took over the bank.",
            "Now there are two questions on everyone\u2019s mind.",
            "This is a little tricky to answer. There are thousands of startups who\u2019ve parked their monies in SVB. If they\u2019re not able to access it now, they can\u2019t pay their employees. They can\u2019t pay their vendors. They can\u2019t run their business as usual. It\u2019s quite problematic.",
            "The other problem is that as per the rules in the US, only up to $250,000 of a person\u2019s bank deposit is insured. And startups have millions of dollars in SVB. Now, because of how concentrated its customer base is, a massive ",
            " of these deposits are actually uninsured.",
            "So startups with money stuck in the back have to hope and pray that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which has taken over the bank, can quickly sell off whatever assets the bank owns and make good a big part of the deposits.",
            "We don\u2019t know yet how bad things could be.",
            "2. Will the rot spread to other banks?",
            "Probably not. SVB did some weird things and got caught in an environment where its biggest customers were in turmoil too. It was a perfect storm for the bank. But other banks have a diversified customer base. They might have still indulged in some poor investment choices but it may not come back to haunt them yet. The problems will be milder.",
            "But just like how the collapse of Silvergate played a part in bringing down SVB, SVB\u2019s collapse could scare everyone. If people lose trust in their banks and believe that all banks have poor practices, then bad stuff will happen. They could rush to pull their money out of the system. So you can expect banks to keep saying things like, \u201cWe are safe. We are fine.\u201d over the next few days. They just need people to believe them.",
            "Anyway, that\u2019s the SVB story. Remember, this is still a developing story and a lot can happen between today, tomorrow, and the day after that. We\u2019ll just have to keep our eyes and ears open. And hope that startups don\u2019t capitulate in this mess.",

Squads step back from their day-to-day activities to get a broader perspective on how they are working, with the aim of improving their self-awareness, allowing them to more clearly see improvement opportunities. The aggregated results from these health checks also provide the teams\u2019 leadership with a way to see patterns and trends across multiple squads and over time.",
            "With nearly a decade of squad health checks under our belt, you could say our teams have gotten pretty decent at running health checks. Although it\u2019s not something we track, we estimate 5,000-plus health checks have been run at Spotify since that first post in 2014. Today at least 60% of our teams are committed to running health checks at a regular cadence, using their favourite sets of questions, often with a detailed guide to support the individuals facilitating them. And leaders of these teams routinely use the results as a source of data to support, not judge, teams.\u00a0",

Team leaders can (and should) consider what is relevant to the team right now and design some questions to help reflect that. For example, for teams that\u2026",

These reports are effective for spotting trends, and the results may be used for systemic actions on a larger scale. So make sure you know what leadership is looking for and that you\u2019re able to input that data into the aggregation (for example, by also including those questions).",
            "During the debrief workshop, following a facilitation guide that might be provided is helpful to steer the discussion, but it\u2019s important to remember that the priority should be to facilitate a deeper conversation within the team.\u00a0",
            "One of the powerful aspects of the team health check is the opportunity to help the team step outside their day-to-day habits of communication. Teams often approach the health check discussions in the same way they would other conversations or meetings \u2014 if they have the habit of rushing towards actions, or of talking in circles, that same behaviour will likely come into play during the health check. By helping them communicate differently, you can create a space for individuals to be comfortable with vulnerability and encourage empathy between team members. We believe this can be the most valuable outcome from a team health check \u2014 it will support higher levels of trust that can ultimately help the team to be more effective and high-performing day to day.",
            "Jumping to problem-solving is a human instinct, but digging a bit deeper helps ensure you\u2019re solving the right problem. You can help the team go deeper by using lots of open questions, like:",
            "We seldom get through everything we think we might, and that\u2019s OK. In fact, a well-facilitated, deep conversation about any one topic that is important to the team may yield better results than force-fitting topics, when it comes to helping the team work better together. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of trying to get through everything in your facilitation plan.",
            "Give closure to the conversation. This will help people leave the session with a feeling of satisfaction. A quick way to close is to ask everyone to share \u2018one insight and one thing they will do differently as a result of today\u2019s conversation\u2019. This helps each person acknowledge their takeaway and set an intent. If you need to, cut short a conversation in order to make time to close out together. A simple acknowledgement that you are out of time for now will help to dissolve any tension that someone might have about not finishing.",
            "This part often gets overlooked because everyone goes back to their usual day-to-day routine. Don\u2019t fall into this trap that reinforces \u2018meh\u2019 health checks. It\u2019s not enough to capture the actions and leave them with the team. The health check isn\u2019t done until you:",
            "\u00a0",
            "Debrief with those closest to the team who attended the health check (usually the engineering manager and product manager) on what you learned, and plan your next steps.\u00a0",
            "Perhaps actions should be added to the team\u2019s backlog. Perhaps the conversation didn\u2019t result in any actions, and it would be good to have a discussion about this at stand-up in a day or so, after the team has had a chance to absorb what they learned in the conversation.",
            "Your department/organisation should look at the aggregated view of all the health check results to see if there are any patterns and learnings. If this isn\u2019t something that you already do today, we suggest at least doing something lightweight. For example, ask all managers to bring their top three team health priorities to a meeting to discuss how you could work on those at an organisational level.",
            "This approach to our health checks has supported our teams and leaders to have better conversations and outcomes. So the next time you\u2019re planning a round of health checks, remember that one size does not fit all! Customise your health check to best fit the team, dig deep to find the underlying issues, and follow through afterwards.",

            "The age-old dilemma that technical co-founders get confronted with: should I build it from scratch or buy some off-the-shelf solution? I\u2019ve asked myself this question many times over the last years and it\u2019s not as black and white as it seems. It can be one or the other, or a gradient mix of both of them as long as it fulfills the particular purpose and pushes the company further.",
            "We\u2019re not talking about building tools that surround your company\u2019s non-critical operations. That\u2019s never a good idea unless you hit specific bottlenecks and have the resources (not VC money) to invest. If you\u2019re a 2-year-old startup and want to write your own CRM or ERP system \u2014 sure you can do that not. Is it reasonable? Absolutely not.",
            "I\u2019ve noticed an interesting trend \u2014 non-tech people are usually the ones who suggest going with a third-party vendor, while developers are eager to build it. I mean, writing a piece of complicated software sounds fun, I agree, but in the end, neither of them is right.",
            "There is no right way here, only tradeoffs \u2014 between speed, cost, control, and functionality. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019d like to discuss with you, some of the factors that need to be considered before you decide on the build VS buy and the extent of it.",
            "First thing first \u2014 it\u2019s subjective. Some people will tell you that building everything from scratch worked wonders for them, while others say that Salesforce has all the features they need. Great, now moving on.",
            "Two things you need to keep in mind:",
            " Building always requires a big chunk of money and effort upfront. And if you plan XX\u2019000$ for the MVP, you can plan double that for the bugs and changes you will need to do along the way while getting more user feedback. However, after you have that initial version ready \u2014 it\u2019s easy to continue scaling, in comparison to the white-label solution, where the money and effort come later when you decide to customize the software or migrate away from the vendor.",
            " Another advantage of building your own solution is that it can provide a competitive advantage. The more in-house technology you have, the more ahead you are of the copycats, and the harder it is to copy your in-house technology the safer you are. If you rely on an off-the-shelf solution \u2014 others can do the same.",
            " Custom solution = \u00a0longer initially, but may result in a shorter timeline in the long run. Purchasing a SaaS solution = quicker, but it may take longer in the long run once you realize there are things that need to be adopted.",
            " When you buy a COTS solution, you don't own the data, and you need to sign data processing agreements. So it\u2019s a tradeoff between not owning the data VS owning the data but getting compliance. For young startups, this can be a disadvantage as getting compliance is not cheap \u2014 both mentally and $$$. Another point \u2014 SaaS solutions are often targeted by hackers, so there is a slightly elevated risk of leaking data.",
            "Another advantage of building a custom solution is that it provides complete control over design and functionality, allowing you to tailor the solution to your unique needs. COTS by default is a standardized solution. If the stuff that you need can be done out-of-the-box \u2014 great. However, purchasing a SaaS solution means relying on someone else to build and maintain the solution, which can limit your ability to make customizations.",
            "Until you\u2019ve hit product market fit, you shouldn\u2019t build anything other than what is unique to your product. If you are spending time on authentication or forms or worker queue architecture, you\u2019re wasting time.",
            "Frameworks and plug-ins exist to allow this to be all plug and play, so you can focus on building something potentially useful enough for people to pay for it. Product market fit is generally achieved when you can\u2019t keep up with demand for your product. \u201cCan\u2019t keep up\u201d is generally an operational problem first, then a technical problem (the Do Things That Don\u2019t Scale stuff catches up to you basically).",

            "For a few years, there\u2019s been a new player in town \u2014 NoCode tools. They\u2019re slightly more flexible than the standardized solution and slightly more cost-effective than building from scratch, a sort-of middle ground.",
            "NoCode solutions are a wildcard in the build vs buy dilemma. On the one hand, they allow you to build custom solutions quickly and easily, just like a SaaS solution. But on the other hand, you still have the control and customization options of building from scratch. So it\u2019s like a 50% buy 50% build.",
            "NoCode is great if you don't have a technical co-founder but still want to build your business.",
            "Use a it to quickly build a proof of concept, extend it as much as the no code allows, and once you have the product market fit and have a scalability issue \u2014 invest in building a custom solution base on the noCode logic.

The net worth of the data is increasing every day. It could be a show stopper to lose it. You could get stuck, with as an example a CRM system that doesn\u2019t grow with your business needs.

            "Then at some point Boostrap took over the world. A number of comprehensive frontend frameworks were born\u2014CSS (probably Sass) and JavaScript included. And nowadays we have JavaScript libraries that people build frontend frameworks around, complete with fully-functional components\u2014building blocks for making websites and web apps of any sort.",
            "But with that kind of power comes complexity, bloat, performance issues, and dependency hell. So when beginning a new project, I like start by thinking about the bare minimum needed to get going. It\u2019s also an excuse to waste time scouring the web for goodies as I am wont to do.",

That\u2019s just a guess, though.",
            "Personally I would like to see a lot more of these. And I was a little bit surprised to see that the same half dozen frameworks kept popping up everywhere (which is a problem I suppose I\u2019m contributing to now).",

There\u2019s just something satisfying about the idea that I can write some HTML and then grab a nice pre-made theme that Just Works\u2122. It\u2019s hard to describe why I like this so much. In a way I suppose it\u2019s nostalgic\u2014these themes take me back to a time when I had first discovered HTML and CSS and learned to make simple webpages by hand (as opposed to using a site builder).",

            "The Thai monkeys produced stone artifacts \u201cindistinguishable from what we see at the beginning of the [human] archeological record \u2014 what we see as the onset of being human,\u201d said Lydia Luncz of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, a co-author on the study.\u00a0",
            "The monkeys \u2014 long-tailed macaques \u2014 seem to have made their artifacts by\u00a0accident, not by design.\u00a0But in many ways, that only makes the finding more disruptive.\u00a0",
            "Tool use in nonhuman primates is nothing new. Long-tailed macaques \u2014 the small, mischievous and social primates often seen in Southeast Asian cities and temple complexes \u2014 use stones to break through shells and get at the meat inside.\u00a0",
            "This use can be surprisingly sophisticated.\u00a0Macaques foraging on beaches choose out long, narrow and heavy stones \u2014 what anthropologists\u00a0call an \u2018axe hammer\u2019 \u2014 to pop open oyster shells.\u00a0",
            "Such narrow stones are perfect for breaking open the brittle shells, while\u00a0wider rocks risk smashing them into sharp fragments \u2014 endangering the incautious monkey who tries to stick its face into the jagged hole.",
            "The Planck group found the first evidence of macaques adapting this seafood-foraging use of stone tools to another food: nuts.",
            "In particular, the monkeys targeted the hard, oil-rich nuts of African oil palms \u2014 introduced as a cash crop across the region.",
            "In an abandoned oil palm plantation on a national park site, the monkeys would create nut-cracking \u2018stations\u2019 beneath the feral trees.",
            "There they break open the palm fruit\u2019s oil-rich pit between hand-wielded hammer rocks and a thick, flat stone that functions as an anvil.\u00a0",
            "Camera traps showed that when the nut-cracking monkeys miss a strike, the two stones bang together.",
            "That collision sometimes strikes a flake off of one of the rocks \u2014 something very similar to the toolmaking process archeologists call \u201cknapping.\u201d",
            "Ancient humans used knapping to break apart rocks to create an incredibly flexible set of tools \u2014 the earliest forms of which cannot be distinguished from the ones macaques made by accident.",
            "That points to a possibility that could throw a wrench into the established narrative, Luncz said: that\u00a0\u201call the conoidal flakes we find in the archaeological record \u2014 deemed to be intentionally made \u2014 could be unintentional byproducts.\u201d",
            "In many ways, the Science paper lays the groundwork for a more intuitive story of human evolution than the idea that stone flakes \u2014 and the human cultural flowering they enabled \u2014 sprung forth by deliberate invention.",
            "That narrative requires a lot of additional steps, Luncz said. It presupposes axe-swinging early humans with brains big enough to plan their \u201cextraction\u201d of the perfect flakes from rocks and hand-object movement sophisticated enough to deliver it.",
            "By contrast, the Planck team\u2019s findings suggest another possibility \u2014 that the evolution of human tool use could have been more fitful and staggered.",
            "In one possible scenario, ancient humans \u2014 like modern macaques \u2014 could have first produced stone flakes as a byproduct as they bashed apart bones, nuts or shellfish with rocks.",
            "Then, far later \u2014 perhaps alongside some kill where they had used rocks to hammer open bones to get at the marrow within \u2014 early humans may have turned to these razor-sharp flakes, which would once have been discarded as trash, to begin cutting up meat.",
            "Or, as Luncz put it: \u201cAn accidental stone breakage could have led us down the evolutionary trajectory of making stone tools.\u201d",
            "That idea remains controversial in the field, however.\u00a0",
            "\u201cYou will not believe the fights we had to fight,\u201d Luncz said.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Even calling the macaque-produced stone flakes \u201cartifacts\u201d was controversial because some scientists felt it implied an overlap between tool use by Homo sapiens and other primates that wasn\u2019t justified.",
            "\u2018Artifacts,\u2019 after all, shares its root with \u2018art\u2019 and \u2018artifice\u2019 \u2014 words that suggest intention, planning and humanity.\u00a0",
            "\u201cPeople were not happy with monkeys being able to create those artifacts,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd somewhere in the records of macaque and early hominid tools, there must be a difference. But right now, the diagnostic criteria we\u2019re using can\u2019t find one.\u201d",
            "The Planck study was controversial in part because it brushed against broader, entrenched debates over nothing less than what it means to be human.",
            "In particular, there is a long-standing debate over whether animal social learning can be described using a word as loaded, venerable and human-inflected as \u201cculture.\u201d",
            "Luncz was careful about using that word. But she noted that \u201cnut cracking in primates is socially transmitted \u2014 a monkey in isolation doesn\u2019t learn it. It\u2019s our material culture that we use to recreate our history.\u201d",
            "The questions that studies like this explore are central to human identity, Luncz said. \u201cWhy are we the way we are? How did we evolve to become this crazy successful monkey that occupies the whole planet?\u201d",
            "\u201cTool use plays an enormous role in this. We\u2019re so successful at it that we\u2019re destroying our planet \u2014 and that all started with a stone tool.\u201d",
            "In a bitter irony, macaques\u2019 very social ingenuity and flexibility \u2014 a hallmark of primates \u2014 endangers attempts to preserve and learn from them.\u00a0",
            "As their habitats have been cleared in Asia\u2019s rapid urban and agricultural expansion \u2014 with forests cleared for suburbs and cash crops like the ubiquitous oil palm \u2014 macaque populations have plummeted.\u00a0",
            "Last year, the species was listed as \u201cendangered\u201d on the canonical IUCN Red List after a population collapse on a scale \u201cwe\u2019ve never seen in the primate world,\u201d Luncz said.",
            "That collapse is mainly invisible: as their habitats have vanished, many macaques have taken refuge in cities and public parks, where they are a familiar and often confrontational presence.",
            "\u201cPeople aren\u2019t aware that they are an endangered species,\u201d Luncz said. Urban macaques are \u201calways in their face, always there and in the way. They break into houses, steal tourists\u2019 sunglasses and bite children.\u201d",
            "In many Asian cities, a push to conserve these primate relatives is greeted with responses similar to an American or European proposing \u201cto conserve pigeons.\u201d",
            "But as the species\u2019 wild, forest-dwelling populations break down \u2014 and their social memory with it \u2014 our ability to learn about our own deep origins is also slipping away.",
            "\u201cThe chance we have now to compare our history and living primates is a very fast-closing window,\u201d Luncz said. She added that without far more aggressive conservation, we will only have the mute record of ancient archeology to rely on.",

            " on his favorite website about OpenAI, the research laboratory-turned-company that he co-founded along with a number of other tech luminaries in 2015. Following up on a tweet by finance writer Genevieve Roch-Decter, ",
            " \u201cOpenAI ws created as an open source\u2026 non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all.\u201d",
            "In December of 2015, Musk really was part of ",
            " \u2013 also including Greg Brockman, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, and current CEO Sam Altman \u2013 who founded OpenAI as a non-profit group, with the aim of freely collaborating on AI with outside institutions and sharing all patents and research with the public. Their ultimate stated goal was to develop the first AGI \u2013 ",

            "And to be fair, Musk\u2019s claim that the project was intended specifically as a counter to Google\u2019s AI research is largely accurate. ",
            " about OpenAI notes that the group lured skilled engineers away from Google not by competing on salary \u2013 which was not even possible at what was then a non-profit \u2013 but by leaning into their idealistic and collaborative vision. Musk and Altman also speak about their dark concerns about corporate AI research, which could even lead to \u2013 and we\u2019re quoting ",

This was only enough to get started, as it turns out, AI research is a considerably expensive pursuit. The massive language and image training models on which OpenAI\u2019s apps run require a staggering amount of computing power; ",
            " costs the company millions of dollars per day.",
            "That said, Musk\u2019s personal involvement in the OpenAI project ended in 2018, when he ",
            ". At the time, he cited a potential conflict of interest, as his electric vehicle company Tesla was also developing AI systems for its self-driving cars. He stated his intention to continue advising and donating to the project.",
            "Just the next year, however, OpenAI transitioned entirely from a non-profit organization to a \u201ccapped\u201d for-profit company. (The \u201ccap\u201d means that OpenAI\u2019s backers can\u2019t ever make more than 100 times their investment in the company.) ",
            ", Altman and co-founder Ilya Sutskever (a former Google research scientist) explained the move as necessary to pay for all that ",
            ", as well as recruitment. As the elite engineers required for cutting-edge industry-advancing AI research are in high demand, it would take more than just idealism to convince them to ditch jobs at deep-pocketed firms like Google, DeepMind, or Facebook (now Meta). ",

            "Still, while Musk may act shocked - SHOCKED! - on social media that OpenAI has progressed in this direction, there were some early signs that its early egalitarianism were never designed to last. For starters, a lot of the early minds behind the project \u2013 including Musk, Altman, and Brockman \u2013 were already Silicon Valley insiders with deep connections to the very large companies whose efforts they planned to rival. Was their involvement from the start an early indicator that OpenAI would shift from a slightly competitive to a fully collaborative force? Maybe.",

OpenAI recruit Yann LeCun explained that, from the start, there were \u201csome competing objectives,\u201d noting the close relationship between the group and the companies enrolled in Altman\u2019s startup incubator, Y Combinator. Brockman also noted at the time that the group didn\u2019t plan to make everything it developed open-source, and was also open to the idea of eventually \u201cchanging tactics in the long term\u201d and patenting some of their developments for profit.",

            "\u201cIt shouldn't be a luxury to be able to care for your pets,\u201d he said. \u201cPets are part of the family just like kids, and it shouldn't be something that's reserved for the high net worth of the people that are super connected. Every single pet family should have access to the same level of care, the same frequency and the best doctors at a price they can afford.\u201d ",
            "But Werber\u2019s first foray into entrepreneurship dates back to 2012 when he founded his first startup Lootsie, an advertising platform. But unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have much luck getting it off the ground. ",
            "\u201cI took all the network and a lot of the investors that invested in that company that were our first investors at Airvet that got it off the ground,\u201d he said. ",
            "While his first startup didn\u2019t make it, Werber admitted that one of the biggest lessons he learned was the importance of having a good team. ",
            "\u201cTeam is everything,\u201d Werber said. \u201cBetter than the product, better than the idea, better than the TAM or the market. Your team and largely your leadership team is going to be \u2014 especially at an early stage \u2014 the key to success.\u201d ",
            "Because that aspect was crucial, Werber was sure to choose wisely. ",
            "\u201cWe actually went through a couple iterations of our leadership team before we got it to where it is today, \" he said. \u201cWhich is like the perfect Apollo crew.\u201d ",
            "In addition to having the perfect crew, Werber said another big takeaway from his first startup was knowing when to say no. ",
            "\u201cAs a first time founder, there's so much excitement, so much passion and it drives everything,\u201d Werber expressed. \u201cYou become almost blinded by just building off pure passion and energy and you want to say yes to everything.\u201d ",
            "But even so, Werber, a second time founder, is constantly learning new things about the business. ",
            "\u201cThe first thing when you go to market is you want to sell to the people who need your product, and that's the most obvious path,\u201d he said. \u201cSo who needs our product? Who's the end user? It's pet families.\u201d ",
            "Werber said that\u2019s how Airvet initially started\u2013following the direct to consumer route. ",
            "\u201cBut there's a big difference \u2014especially in this market \u2014 between growth at all costs, and actually building a business that has healthy margins, healthy unit economics, and really taking a step back and looking at the fundamentals of the business,\u201d he said\u201cIs this scalable? Am I going to be able to build a profitable business over the next few years with this path to growth?\u201d",
            "While Airvet was seeing tremendous growth, Werber saw the uptick in customer acquisition cost and it forced him to pivot to an enterprise solution. ",
            "\u201cWe could do all the optimization we can,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it ends up being an extraordinarily expensive game, you could tell that the current strategy wasn't working.\u201d ",
            "Werber added, \u201cwe acquire them (customers) through businesses. So it's known as B to B to C. So now what we're doing is we're selling to enterprises, largely employers and their employee benefits teams within those large jumbo employers to create a new category of pet family benefits. So that the end user is the pet family, in this case, the employee gets Airvet at no cost, and it's subsidized by the employer.\u201d ",

            "Installing globally meant you didn't have any isolation between your projects. This led to issues like version conflicts between what one of your projects might need compared to another one. It also meant you had no idea what requirements your project actually had since you had no way of actually testing your assumptions of what you needed. This was an issue if you needed to share you code with someone else as you didn't have a way to test that you weren't accidentally wrong about what your dependencies were.",

            "In the middle of last week, Moody's Investors Service delivered alarming news to ",
            ", the parent of Silicon Valley Bank: the ratings firm was preparing to downgrade the bank's credit.",
            "That phone call, described by two people familiar with the situation, began the process toward Friday's spectacular collapse of the startup-focused lender, the biggest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis.",
            "Friday's collapse sent jitters through global markets and walloped banking stocks. Investors worry that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate increases to fight inflation are exposing vulnerabilities in the financial system.",
            "Details of SVB's failed response to the prospect of the downgrade, reported by Reuters for the first time, show how quickly confidence in financial institutions can erode. The failure also sent shockwaves through California's startup economy, with many companies unsure of how much of their deposits they can recover and worrying about how to make payroll.",
            "The Moody's call came after the value of the bonds where SVB had parked its money fell due to the higher interest rates.",
            "Worried the downgrade could undermine the confidence of investors and clients in the bank's financial health, SVB Chief Executive Greg Becker's team called Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) bankers for advice and flew to New York for meetings with Moody's and other ratings firms, the sources said.",
            "The sources asked not to be identified because they are bound by confidentiality agreements.",
            "SVB then worked on a plan over the weekend to boost the value of its holdings. It would sell more than $20 billion worth of low-yielding bonds and reinvest the proceeds in assets that deliver higher returns.",
            "The transaction would generate a loss, but if SVB could fill that funding hole by selling shares, it would avoid a multi-notch downgrade, the sources said.",
            "The plan backfired.",
            "News of the share sale spooked clients, primarily technology startups, that rushed to withdraw their deposits, upending the capital raising. Regulators stepped in on Friday, shutting down the bank and putting it in receivership.",
            "SVB, Goldman Sachs and Moody's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
            "As SVB executives debated when to proceed with the fundraising, they heard from Moody's that the downgrade was coming this week, the sources said.",
            "SVB sprang into action in the hopes of softening the blow.",
            "The bank lined up private equity firm General Atlantic, which agreed to buy $500 million of the $2.25 billion stock sale, while another investor said it could not reach a deal on SVB's timeline, the sources said.",
            "By Wednesday, SVB had sold the bond portfolio for a $1.8 billion loss.",
            "Moody's downgraded the bank, but only by a notch because of SVB's bond portfolio sale and plan to raise capital.",
            "Ideally, the stock sale would have been completed by before the market opened on Thursday, to avoid the sale being jeopardized by any declines in SVB's shares once news of the sale got out. But the sources said that was not an option given the tight schedule.",
            "SVB had not done the preparatory work needed to sign confidentiality agreements with investors who would commit to a deal of such a size. Its lawyers advised the bank that investors would need at least 24 hours to digest new downbeat financial projections and complete the sale, the sources said.",
            "Reuters could not determine why SVB did not start those preparations earlier.",
            "SVB's stock plunged on news of the share sale, ending Thursday down 60% at $106.04. Goldman Sachs bankers still hoped they could close the sale at $95, the sources said.",
            "Then news came of venture capital firms advising startups they had invested in to pull money out of Silicon Valley Bank for fear of an imminent bank run.",
            "This quickly became a self-fulfilling prophecy: General Atlantic and other investors walked away and the stock sale collapsed.",
            "General Atlantic did not respond to a request for comment.",
            "California banking regulators closed the bank on Friday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) receiver. The FDIC will dispose of its assets.",

            "Those Democrats argued that Dodd-Frank went too far when it came to regulating community and regional banks, and that easing a few rules would free up credit for rural areas and small businesses. And to make their case, again and again, they cited one man in specific: former Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, one of the 2010 bill\u2019s chief authors, who argued that despite fears from the left\u2014as well as his own opposition to a different provision in the bill, ",

            "Dodd-Frank imposed additional regulatory safeguards on banks with more than $50 billion in assets, but the rollback that passed this week, among other things, raises that threshold to $250 billion. Signature Bank has more than $40 billion in assets and can now grow significantly without automatically facing additional regulation. Frank has served on Signature\u2019s board for three years and has received more than $1 million in payments from the bank during that time.",
            "For Frank\u2019s part, he acknowledged to the Post that Signature will likely benefit from the new law, but said that had nothing to do with his thinking. And the paper did find evidence to support the idea that Frank was in favor of raising the threshold to a lesser degree while he was still in Congress. Still, it stands to reason the fact he was getting paid by the bank at the same time he was ",

            "One of the most catastrophic episodes in modern library history was the Ashburnham House fire. On the night of 29 October 1731, a fire took hold below the room which held the famous Cotton collection, containing many of the most iconic historical and literary treasures from early times, among them Magna Carta, Beowulf and the Lindisfarne Gospels. Some of these items escaped the flames intact, others were singed or damaged by the water used to douse the fire, while many hundreds were burned significantly or completely destroyed. The fire-damaged survivors are held today at the British Library, but many of them remain extraordinarily difficult to handle or are too blackened to be read with the naked eye.",

            "But help is now at hand. Thanks to the incredible generosity of the Goldhammer Foundation, since 2020 the Library has been engaged in a project to bring some of the fragmentary Cotton remains to life. We have used multispectral imaging to photograph a selection of the damaged items, and our conservation team has employed new techniques to re-house some of the most vulnerable fragments and to improve the handling of the bound volumes.",
            "Over the coming months, we will feature on this Medieval Manuscripts Blog stories about the most recent restoration of the burnt Cotton manuscripts, but here is a sample to whet your appetite. In due course, the items themselves will be available to view online in all their glory. The Cotton fire may have had tragic consequences, but there is potentially some light at the end of the tunnel.",

            " (\u2018Book of Flowers'), an important medieval encyclopedia made by Lambert, canon of Saint-Omer, between 1090 and 1100. Among its many texts, the manuscript notably contains an early plan of the city of Jerusalem, near impossible to discern in its current burnt state, but which can now be seen again in the new multispectral images.",
            "A plan of the city of Jerusalem, revealed under multispectral imaging: Cotton MS Fragments I, f. 19r",
            "In the 19th century, many of the fire-damaged Cotton manuscripts underwent intensive restoration, led principally by the efforts of Sir Frederic Madden, Keeper of Manuscripts at the British Museum. During this process, their folios were often remounted and reorganised. However, some of the smallest and most fragile of the burnt fragments could not be reunited with their original volumes and were instead housed separately in nine small boxes, now known as Cotton MS Fragments XXXII. One focus of this project has been the imaging and preservation of these tiny fragments, some measuring as little as a few millimetres in diameter.\u00a0",
            "A burnt fragment from the Cotton collection: Cotton MS Fragments XXXII/2, Fragment 1r",
            "Our project also includes a number of illuminated manuscripts. Particularly notable is an early Gallican Psalter, made in Ireland during the first half of the 10th century. This Psalter was so badly damaged in the 1731 fire that the 1802 catalogue of the Cotton manuscripts stated that it was \u2018desideratur\u2019 (destroyed). The Psalter was subsequently rediscovered by Madden, who remounted and reorganised its pages.",

            "The Psalter features two full-page illustrations, now placed at the beginning of the volume, which depict David killing Goliath (f. 1r) and David enthroned, playing a harp (f. 2r); they were once placed at the openings of Psalms 51 and 102, facing framed initial pages. It also features numerous zoomorphic initials, made up of the bent bodies of ribbon shaped animals or distinctive panels of interlace.",

We would also like to acknowledge the contributions of Dr Christina Duffy (formerly Research Imaging Scientist at the Library) and our conservation team (Gavin Moorhead, Camille Dekeyser, Gary Kelly, Francesca Whymark and Mark Oxtoby), without whom none of this could have been achieved.",

            "Yesterday at around noon in Los Angeles, investor Mark Suster of the venture firm Upfront Ventures began urging \u201c",
            "\u201d on Twitter. Silicon Valley Bank had ",
            " on Wednesday around an effort to strengthen its balance sheet, and startup founders were beginning to fear that their deposits at the tech-friendly, 40-year-old institution were at risk. \u201cM",
            "As we know now, Suster was already too late. The industry was nervous, and the bank\u2019s CEO Greg Becker, serenely addressing the bank\u2019s customers in a Zoom call late yesterday morning, managed to scare them further when he uttered the words: \u201cThe last thing we need you to do is panic.\u201d",
            "By this morning, after trading of Silicon Valley Bank was halted to stop the shares\u2019 free fall \u2014 they\u2019d already plunged more than 80% between Wednesday and Thursday \u2014\u00a0 the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation closed the bank. Then it moved it under the control of the FDIC, which is figuring out next steps as the bank\u2019s customers grapple with ",
            " in the interim.",
            "Today, we asked Suster about his advice yesterday and whether or not he regrets it. During our talk, he also echoed a growing number of others in the startup world who\u2019ve begun ",
            " at what they insist was a small number of VCs who set off alarm bells across the startup ecosystem \u2014 bringing down SVB but also, potentially, triggering a contagion. Here\u2019s that interview, edited lightly for length and clarity.",
            "MS: SVB generally doesn\u2019t require exclusivity unless you take out debt. The problem is that a lot of people take out debt, and we\u2019ve been warning [portfolio companies] about this for a year.",
            "About half have a relationship with SVB. Maybe half of those have alternative accounts.",
            "No.",
            "No.",
            "No. I heard about $12 billion exited from SVB yesterday, and SVB has a little under $200 billion in assets, so that\u2019s 6.5% to 7% of [its assets] that left in one day. That\u2019s not catastrophic, but the Fed knew that was going to accelerate. They don\u2019t want a bank run, so my guess is that the Fed, in a perfect situation, would like someone to buy SBV, and I suspect they are talking with every bank and doing a review as we speak.",
            "Imagine you have a whole bunch of people evaluating buying a bank. How do you evaluate it when you don\u2019t know how much is fleeing? How do you catch a falling knife? By [shutting down SVB this morning], the Fed stopped that knife from falling; now, I think we\u2019ll see an orderly sale by Sunday. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, [someone will step in to buy it]. Then I believe panic will stop, because if you are pulling out of SVB because you are worried about SVB, that will no longer be a concern.",
            "A bank\u2019s valuation is correlated but mostly uncorrelated from its assets. You have debt holders and equity holders, and if a company goes bankrupt, debt holders get money before the equity holders. What people were betting with SVB is that the common stockholders weren\u2019t going to get anything because SVB was going to go bankrupt; [its market cap and assets] became uncorrelated because they didn\u2019t think SBV would survive.",
            "What matters is: are there assets and is there value here? SVB is lender to a very cash-rich and well-run tech industry and these clients are coveted. SVB doesn\u2019t just serve startups but VC funds and PE funds. Imagine that in one fell swoop you get access to them? It\u2019s why a bunch of firms are working with the Fed, trying to figure out [what\u2019s what] right now, including a bunch of hedge funds and other large PE funds, as well as banks.",
            "The Fed has one objective, and that is to avoid contagions. Every other regional or not-scaled bank right now is being hit. That\u2019s why they will force something to happen by Monday.",
            "This isn\u2019t officially bankruptcy, but it\u2019s as close as you get. Will [a buyer] give money to equity holders? I think those shares could go to zero; an acquirer might well decide they don\u2019t want to bail out equity holders, but shareholders are different from depositors.",
            "This is 24 hours old. We will likely start those conversations next week. We told our CEOs that if you are in a position where you need a bridge loan in the next two weeks, you should assemble your board, because this is a decision that needs to be reached by a board of directors. If people believe in your prospects, it shouldn\u2019t be hard to get money for one to two payrolls. If they don\u2019t, it may accelerate your demise, but [going out of business] was probably going to happen anyway.",
            "I assure you I did not. Every single VC I know was telling people, \u2018We think your deposits are safe with SVB. It would be prudent to take some money because you could have a liquidity crisis for a week, but we don\u2019t think a run on the bank makes sense.\u2019 Experienced, professional VCs of Silicon Valley understand that a bank run damages everybody.",
            "No. I said a handful of people were telling people to run for the door and congratulating themselves for it. Leave aside what this does to SVB. If the Fed didn\u2019t step up, how many bankruptcies would there be and other knock-on effects? These VCs are congratulating themselves. I\u2019m seeing emails from VCs to their LPs \u2014 of which I am in some firms \u2014 and they are forwarding these things like, \u2018Aren\u2019t I super smart?\u2019",
            "My guess is this is solved by Monday or Tuesday and it will impact very few people. If it extends beyond a week or two, it will impact a lot of companies across the industry. Anyone who has payroll today or Monday needs investors to do quick bridge loans from investors or to delay payroll for 48 hours.",
            "What gives me confidence is the Fed knows [the implications if it doesn\u2019t].",
            "Employees of SVB who had large amounts of money in the company\u2019s equity because they believed in their employer. Equity holders.",
            "I think you\u2019re likely to see people trust bigger banks rather than smaller banks. That\u2019s what I would advise personally. I personally already spread my money across bank accounts because I\u2019m subject to FDIC limits and a cautious person. I\u2019m already heavily in T-bills and other, safe high-yielding assets. As for Upfront, we bank with SBV and we have accounts tied to Morgan Stanley. We\u2019ll probably open two or three accounts with other banks next week."

In this case, there is\n              no chance of immediate peril, so waiting to see what happens as people use these tools seems like a reasonable\n              reasonable.

            "So, at this point, my personal interaction with the phase change that Sloan describes has been mostly passive: I read\n              about what others are doing and think about the results of their exploration. Perhaps this post is a guilty conscience\n              asserting that I should be doing more. Really, though, I think of it more as an active form of inaction: an effort to\n              collect some of my thinking as I slowly respond to the changes that are coming. Perhaps some day soon I will feel moved\n              to use of these tools as I write code of my own. For now, though, I am content to watch from the sidelines.

            " ",
            ", it is outpaced by other domains due to a lack of datasets available on a scale comparable to large text corpora or image datasets. \n",
            "\nToday we introduce ",
            ", a new generalist robotics model that overcomes these issues by transferring knowledge from varied visual and language domains to a robotics system. We began with ",
            ", a powerful large language model, and \u201cembodied\u201d it (the \u201c",
            "\u201d in PaLM-E), by complementing it with sensor data from the robotic agent. This is the key difference from ",
            " to bring large language models to robotics \u2014 rather than relying on only textual input, with PaLM-E we train the language model to directly ingest raw streams of robot sensor data. The resulting model not only enables highly effective robot learning, but is also a state-of-the-art general-purpose visual-language model, while maintaining excellent language-only task capabilities.\n",
            "\nOn the one hand, PaLM-E was primarily developed to be a model for robotics, and it solves a variety of tasks",
            "on ",
            "types of robots and for ",
            " modalities (images, robot states, and ",
            "). At the same time, PaLM-E is a generally-capable vision-and-language model. It can perform visual tasks, such as describing images, detecting objects, or classifying scenes, and is also proficient at language tasks, like quoting poetry, solving math equations or generating code.  \n",
            "\nPaLM-E combines our most recent large language model, ",
            ", together with one of our most advanced vision models, ",
            ". The largest instantiation of this approach, built on PaLM-540B, is called PaLM-E-562B and sets a new state of the art on the visual-language ",
            " benchmark, without task-specific fine-tuning, and while retaining essentially the same general language performance as PaLM-540B.\n",
            "\nTechnically, PaLM-E works by injecting observations into a pre-trained language model. This is realized by transforming sensor data, e.g., images, into a representation through a procedure that is comparable to how words of natural language are processed by a language model. \n",
            "\nLanguage models rely on a mechanism to represent text mathematically in a way that neural networks can process. This is achieved by first splitting the text into so-called tokens that encode (sub)words, each of which is associated with a high-dimensional vector of numbers, the token embedding. The language model is then able to apply mathematical operations (e.g., matrix multiplication) on the resulting sequence of vectors to predict the next, most likely word token. By feeding the newly predicted word back to the input, the language model can iteratively generate a longer and longer text.\n",
            "\nThe ",
            " to PaLM-E are text and other modalities \u2014 images, robot states, scene embeddings, etc. \u2014 in an arbitrary order, which we call \"multimodal sentences\". For example, an input might look like, \"What happened between <img_1> and <img_2>?\", where <img_1> and <img_2> are two images. The ",
            " is text generated auto-regressively by PaLM-E, which could be an answer to a question, or a sequence of decisions in text form. \n",
            "\n  The idea of PaLM-E is to train encoders that convert a variety of inputs into the same space as the natural word token embeddings. These continuous inputs are mapped into something that resembles \"words\" (although they do not necessarily form discrete sets). Since both the word and image embeddings now have the same dimensionality, they can be fed into the language model.",
            "\nWe initialize PaLM-E for training with pre-trained models for both the language (",
            ") and vision components (",
            ", a.k.a. ViT). All parameters of the model can be updated during training.\n",
            "\nPaLM-E offers a new paradigm for training a generalist model, which is achieved by framing robot tasks and vision-language tasks together through a common representation: taking images and text as input, and outputting text. A key result is that PaLM-E attains significant ",
            " ",
            " from both the vision and language domains, improving the effectiveness of robot learning.\n",
            "\n  Results show that PaLM-E can address a large set of robotics, vision and language tasks simultaneously without performance degradation compared to training individual models on individual tasks. Further, the visual-language data ",
            " the performance of the robot tasks. This transfer enables PaLM-E to learn robotics tasks efficiently in terms of the number of examples it requires to solve a task.",
            "\nWe evaluate PaLM-E on three robotic environments, two of which involve real robots, as well as general vision-language tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and general language tasks. When PaLM-E is tasked with making decisions on a robot, we pair it with a ",
            " ",
            " policy to translate text into low-level robot actions.\n",
            "\nIn the first example below, a person asks a mobile robot to bring a bag of chips to them. To successfully complete the task, PaLM-E produces a plan to find the drawer and open it and then responds to changes in the world by updating its plan as it executes the task. In the second example, the robot is asked to grab a green block. Even though the block has not been seen by that robot, PaLM-E still generates a step-by-step plan that generalizes beyond the training data of that robot.\n",
            "\nIn the second environment below, the same PaLM-E model solves very long-horizon, precise tasks, such as \u201csort the blocks by colors into corners,\u201d on a different type of robot. It directly looks at the images and produces a sequence of shorter textually-represented actions \u2014 e.g., \u201cPush the blue cube to the bottom right corner,\u201d \u201cPush the blue triangle there too.\u201d \u2014 long-horizon tasks that were out of scope for autonomous completion, even in ",
            ". We also demonstrate the ability to generalize to new tasks not seen during training time (zero-shot generalization), such as pushing red blocks to the coffee cup.\n",
            "\n  The third ",
            " is inspired by the field of ",
            " (TAMP), which studies combinatorially challenging planning tasks (rearranging objects) that confront the robot with a very high number of possible action sequences. We show that with a modest amount of training data from an expert TAMP planner, PaLM-E is not only able to also solve these tasks, but it also leverages visual and language knowledge transfer in order to more effectively do so.\n",
            "\nAs a visual-language generalist, PaLM-E is a competitive model, even compared with the best vision-language-only models, including ",
            " and ",
            ". In particular, PaLM-E-562B achieves the highest number ever reported on the challenging ",
            " dataset, which requires not only visual understanding but also external knowledge of the world. Further, this result is reached with a generalist model, without fine-tuning specifically on only that task.\n",
            "\nPaLM-E pushes the boundaries of how generally-capable models can be trained to simultaneously address vision, language and robotics while also being capable of transferring knowledge from vision and language to the robotics domain. There are additional topics investigated in further detail in the ",
            ", such as how to leverage ",
            " with PaLM-E and also the extent to which PaLM-E, with greater model scale, experiences less ",
            " of its language capabilities.\n",
            "\nPaLM-E not only provides a path towards building more capable robots that benefit from other data sources, but might also be a key enabler to other broader applications using multimodal learning, including the ability to unify tasks that have so far seemed separate. \n",

            " because he believed it made technology easier for people to use.",
            "The second wave of skeuomorphism was at the end of the first decade of the 2000s. The rise of mobile devices forced designers to use skeuomorphism yet again to help users understand how to interact with these new devices. Back in 2008, the concept of the touch screen was new for many users, so designers created UI elements that allowed users to reference their prior experience. For example, the icon for the camera app in Apple iOS 6 had 3D effects like drop shadows, depth, and textures to make it resemble a real-world camera.",
            "Designers used skeuomorphic design both in small elements like icons, as well as larger elements like UI backgrounds.",
            "A few years after Steve Jobs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death in 2011, Apple abandoned skeuomorphism. There were a few major reasons why Apple and other design companies made that decision:",
            "Many designers believe that skeuomorphism is dead, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not true. Skeuomorphism exists in subtle visual details within many products that we use today. For example, in 2020 Apple brought elements of skeuomorphism into the macOS design called ",

            "To build Zune, designers created a new visual language called ",
            ", which was Microsoft\u2019s interpretation of flat aesthetics. Metro was quite the opposite of skeuomorphism. With minimalism at its core, the goal behind this language was to remove all purely decorative elements and make the design purely utilitarian. Metro was one of the first instances of flat design in digital products and Microsoft used this language for many products, including Windows 8.",
            "This established the trend of flat design, which strips out any three-dimensional elements. It removes any stylistic details that try to imitate the real-world. Everything that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of a flat design appears as if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lying flat on a single surface. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the name \u00e2\u0080\u009cflat design\u00e2\u0080\u009d came from.",

            "However, flat design has a major flaw. Flat design is great for experienced users who are highly attuned to digital interaction, but it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the most intuitive language for users who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much experience with digital interactions.",
            "Since flat aesthetics trim all visual design details, the final design has weak ",
            ". This can cause a lot of usability problems, because users have to guess whether a certain element is interactive or not. Without visual cues it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much harder to predict how elements will behave.",
            "In an attempt to solve this problem, the design community developed Flat 2.0, a visual style that embodies all the sleek, minimalistic characteristics of flat design with a few, notable exceptions that move it a bit closer to 3D. For example, it introduces only subtle shadows and gradients to offer an improved UX. Since then, Flat 2.0 has become the de-facto standard for app and ",

Material Design uses realism only as a tool to make our brains more familiar with how the interface works.",

Previous work sequencing the Pfizer bivalent vaccines utilized a method that sequenced both the RNA and DNA in the sample. The RNA-Seq kit employed favored sequencing RNA and under estimated the DNA contamination levels in the vaccine. This made it difficult to assess the % of the plasmid DNA that was linear versus circular DNA. To address this problem, we RNase A treated the sample and sequenced the remaining DNA. RNase A digests RNA into small pieces that can be eliminated with purification. This enabled a deeper sampling of the DNA based molecules without the mRNA sequence obscuring and suppressing the depth of coverage for the plasmid vector.",

            " was nearly omnipresent in early 20th century American life. By 1908, one-fifth of Americans were subscribers. Anyone anywhere in the country could order a copy for free, look through it, and then have anything their heart desired delivered directly to their doorstep. At its peak, the Sears catalog offered over 100,000 items on 1,400 pages. It weighed four pounds.",
            "Today, those 1,400 pages provide us with a snapshot of American life in the first decade of the 20th century, from sheep-shearing machines and cream separators to telephones and china cabinets.\u00a0The Sears catalog tells the tale of a world \u2014 itemized. And starting in 1908, the company that offered America everything began offering what just might be its most audacious product line ever: houses.",
            "From 1908 to 1940, the ",
            " offered complete mail-order houses to the would-be homeowner \u2014 what would come to be called \u201ckit homes.\u201d Customers could select from dozens of different models in Sears Modern Homes Catalog, order blueprints, send in a check, and a few weeks later everything they needed would arrive in a train car, its door secured with a small red wax seal (just like the seal on the back of a letter).",
            "This seal was to be broken on arrival by the new owner, who would open up their boxcar to find over 10,000 pieces of framing lumber, 20,000 cedar shakes, and almost everything else needed to build the home \u2014 all the doors, even the doorknobs.",
            "The lumber came pre-cut, kind of like a giant Ikea set, along with an instruction booklet. Sears promised that, working without a carpenter and only rudimentary skills, a person could finish their Sears mail-order home in less than 90 days.",
            "Sears would go on to ship out some 75,000 homes across the country. In so doing, they helped usher out the era of the custom site-built house, replacing it with the promise that homes could be standardized and affordable. Long before the advent of housing developments and the modern suburb, it was the Sears kit home that gave Americans their first taste of 20th-century domestic life. But it\u2019s also a chapter of housing history that was almost lost.\n",
            "Sears was not the first company to offer kit homes or a mail-order catalog, but it came to dominate the mail-order market in part because its founder, Richard Sears, was that kind of expert that so many people would claim to be over the course of the 20th century but very few actually were: he was a marketing genius. For example, according to lore, he intentionally made the Sears Roebuck catalog a little shorter and narrower than the Montgomery Ward one on the theory that it would naturally get stacked on top.",
            "By 1907, Sears and Roebuck were selling the then equivalent of $1.3 billion of merchandise to American families every year. And it\u2019s around this time that Richard Sears saw a way to sell even more.",
            "Most American families at the time were still living in multi-generational housing. The reigning paradigm of the middle class was the Victorian home with all of these different little rooms for different family members. Sears looked at this idyllic scene of families living in harmony and saw \u2026 a wasted opportunity. Why should newlyweds move into old homes filled with old things when they could move into new homes and fill them with new things from Sears\u203d",
            "The resulting Sears Modern Home Program was a hit, particularly after the end of World War I, the influx of returning veterans triggered a need for more housing. Sears prefabricated almost all of these homes in giant mills situated across the country.",
            "Located in Cairo Illinois, the largest of these mills covered nearly 40 acres, and the sheer variety of homes it shipped out was staggering.",
            "Their first Modern Homes catalog already had over 40 models to choose from, but Sears would go on to offer 447 different designs.",
            "Every house in the catalog had a name ",
            ". So if you always dreamed of living in a California mission-style home, but couldn\u2019t actually move to California, you might consider purchasing Sears\u2019 Alhambra model. Other styles included the Vallonia, the Martha Washington and the Crescent. They ranged from modest and cozy cabins to expansive mansions. Sears even offered a six-classroom schoolhouse, complete with an auditorium and library.",
            "Of course, these were just empty houses when they were built, ready to be filled with stuff \u2014 ideally, stuff from Sears. The company could sell you everything you needed: the house, the furniture, and all the things to put on the furniture \u2014 a whole new life, all from Sears.",
            "Sears offered the promise of convenience at every level. It even had an ad in the front of the catalog showing two Rodessa models \u2014 one of Sears\u2019s most popular houses \u2014 being built side by side. One was built from scratch, essentially, using ordinary building materials and uncut \u201cstick\u201d lumber. The other utilized precut lumber. The message was clear: it would be much easier to build from Sears\u2019 precut parts.",
            "For many families, these were their first homes with things like insulation and central heating. In some neighborhoods, a Sears kit home might be the only house on a block with electricity.",
            "Then, in 1911, Sears began offering mortgages to their customers. Like everything else, they made these easy \u2014 maybe too easy. The Sears home mortgage program started out as one of their keys to success. In lowering the barrier to entry, it had allowed Sears to sell far more kit homes far faster than any of its competitors. But when the Great Depression hit, things got ugly fast. The company ended up foreclosing on tens of thousands of its very own customers. It was a public relations disaster.",
            "After years of declining sales, Sears would finally close its Modern Homes department in 1940. A few other kit home manufacturers \u2014 ones that hadn\u2019t sold mortgages \u2014 survived, but the Sears kit home boom was over. Then came World War II, and with it, the next modern housing boom, featuring the rise of the suburbs and the prefab home \u2014 the kinds of homes we know today.",
            "Meanwhile, most existing Sears homes ended up being sold to new owners who didn\u2019t know what they\u2019d bought, or didn\u2019t care to know. Despite the high quality of the materials, over the decades, as the company became associated with convenience over and above quality, no one wanted to admit that they lived in a home that came from the Sears catalog. It was embarrassing. So a lot of them ended up being renovated beyond recognition. Many were torn down. Others were simply abandoned. And the records for those that remained were destroyed, making it hard to locate Sears homes today.",
            "A little over twenty years ago, on a cold winter day in Elgin, Illinois (a bit outside of Chicago), Rebecca Hunter picked up an old Sears catalog and took it on a walk around the neighborhood, wondering if she might find a real-life home matching the house designs in the book. She wasn\u2019t an architecture expert, or a Sears expert. She was just curious.",
            "Elgin wasn\u2019t known for its Sears homes \u2014 when Hunter moved into the area, it wasn\u2019t really on her radar, or anyone else\u2019s. When she went out on her trek, she recalls she \u201cwasn\u2019t expecting to find any.\u201d It was just for fun, she says, but, \u201cI had a goal. I had a mission and I forgot about the cold.\u201d Yet within a matter of minutes, she spotted her first Sears home: a craftsman-style Avalon that matched her catalog. As she took more and more walks, she found more and more examples.",
            "Hunter started taking notes about styles and locations, but she also wanted to verify her finds. So she began reaching out to residents, sending out mailers asking owners to inspect their homes for special beams bearing part numbers from Sears. Some also found shipping labels on the backs of baseboards or original Sears blueprints. So far, she and her fellow kit house hunters have found over 200 in Elgin.",
            "Remarkably, too, most of the Sears homes Hunter found looked like they were straight out of the catalog. They had barely been altered since the 1920s. She was able to find so many not because Elgin had the most Sears homes but because the homes could still be recognized, thanks to a perfect storm of historical conditions.",
            "When the Elgin Watch Factory, which had employed a quarter of the town, closed in 1964, Elgin entered a localized recession, sparing it from the renovation craze of the 1960s and 70s. Instead, Elgin\u2019s Sears homes simply sat there through the decades, largely untouched. The closing of the watch factory froze the town in time.",
            "Hunter\u2019s study of the Elgin homes, along with the work of other researchers, would help to launch fresh interest in historic kit homes, not just there but also around the country. Today, a crew of kit home hunters has self-styled specialists who organize databases, search Google maps, and photograph historic homes. Mostly, though, they hunt for houses the old-fashioned way, by meeting up in groups of two and three and four and cruising slowly down the streets of obscure midwest towns, in a car, together.",
            "These and other house hunters have helped identify nearly 50,000 kit homes from Sears and other companies. So the next time a ragtag team of researchers armed with cameras, laptops and an old Sears catalog knocks on your door asks if they can take a quick tour or your basement, don\u2019t be frightened. They\u2019re there to help. And who knows? You might even be standing in an as yet undiscovered model.",

Some areas didn\u2019t sign up enough people, and were never built by Sears. In any case, none of those areas were built by the homeowners, only by contractors who were contracted by Sears to do the building. ",

            "So what am I going to address today?",
            "What happened with SVB?",
            "What is the localized impact of SVB failing?",
            "Are there going to be runs on other banks, and are we about to have another 2008 or S&L crisis?",
            "Circle and the topic of \u201cstablecoins\u201d",
            "Let\u2019s do this.",
            "To give the brief background, Silicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983, and fundamentally specializes in providing banking services to technology and life sciences companies. It is based in, unsurprisingly, Santa Clara, and has long been a bastion of the tech community and has linkages to many of the major tech, venture capital, and adjacent firms in the ecosystem.",
            "SVB had a reputation for being front-footed on technological risk, solid understanding of the tech ecosystem, their own ventures arm, and was, in general, not considered to be particularly remarkable from the core banking side of things.",
            "So how did a bank like this blow itself up in spectacular fashion, such that the demise of SVB was basically the fastest bank run in American history and it went from semi-operational to literally dead in under 48 hours?",
            "First, we have to start with COVID. During the pandemic, there was a very dramatic expansion of money supply in order to offset the effects of everything shutting down. A large beneficiary of this situation was the tech sector, as everyone was stuck at home and all-virtual forever all-everything became the investment thesis at the time. VC funds, tech unicorns, and the valley in general had a massive boom in terms of cash and funding. As a result, this happened to SVB\u2019s balance sheet:",
            "That\u2019s a big increase! And as you can see, most of that increase did not go into loans, but rather, into investment securities. Notably, the fact that their balance sheet almost tripled in size directly concurrent with the pandemic meant that when the tide went back out on the stimulus, it was entirely possible that the deposits would go out with them.",
            "As a treasury and risk person at a bank, when you have that kind of deposit inflow, you have to make a judgment call. Your options are essentially the following:",
            "Refuse the deposits, either explicitly or by making the economic terms so poor people move them elsewhere.",
            "Take the deposits, but expect them to be hot money and leave quickly, and thus invest them very conservatively in things like t-bills, ON reverse repo, or other such highly liquid and easy to unwind instruments.",
            "Obviously, #1 is not going to make your management or your customers happy. This is genuinely hard to do. I\u2019ve seen very few banks that have the stomach to just tell potential customers to go away. It does happen once in a while, but it takes above average management with significant confidence to run this playbook.",
            "#3 is, unfortunately, what most people do. I find it personally confounding every single time this happens, but it\u2019s also the most common thing to happen, so maybe I am the problem here for thinking people should do something else? Either way, this path obviously ends in disaster if things don\u2019t break exactly the way you planned for. If rates go up instead of down, and deposits leave, you are now a forced seller at a loss. Do you know what that means for a bank?",
            "At the same time SVB was experiencing those massive gains in deposits, they decided to run play number 3 from the list above. To the best of my knowledge, SVB had an average duration of roughly 4 years for their securities portfolio, and those securities consisted of things like Agency MBS, not just US Treasuries.",
            "For those uninitiated in the complete and total nonsense that is fixed income pricing, here are some basic rules of thumb so you know what happened to the balance sheet at SVB:",
            "Rates and bond prices move in opposite directions. If rates go up, bond prices go down. If rates go down, bond prices go up.",
            "Now I am going to tell you something that is probably going to surprise many of my readers: this happens all the time in banking. Why are banks not constantly dying because of it, then?",
            "First, banks have two forms of accounting they can elect for assets. One is called Held-to-Maturity (HTM), which means you don\u2019t account for gains or losses and just hold the thing as though you will, with certainty, hold it until it matures. This one doesn\u2019t require any change in value unless there is an impairment. The other option is Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting, which means that you have to price your securities and loans at the price you could sell them for in the open market as of that day.",
            "Which one of these is correct? ",
            "That actually depends on the funding base of the bank. If you have long-term funding and can match your obligations with the tenor of your assets, HTM accounting is actually pretty appropriate. If I have a 4yr bond and a 4yr loan against that bond, that\u2019s great! If you have short-term funding that can depart at any time, then MTM is much more appropriate, as you can\u2019t count on holding to maturity.",
            "So how did things go wrong at SVB? They assumed their long-term bonds were matched by long-term deposits, but as it turns out, those were short-term deposits. This is the essence of many bank runs, and is exactly what happened here.",
            "As depositors left, they were forced to sell what had been HTM positions, which crystallized losses, which makes more people worried, which causes more withdrawals, which causes more deposits to leave\u2026 you see where this is going:",
            "Here is where things get interesting. I\u2019m going to start by explaining the common narrative that I am seeing on Twitter and in the popular discourse, and then I\u2019m going to explain what is actually going on.",
            "\u201cWait a minute, SVB is just a bank for rich venture capital folks. If you had over $250k of money there, you can take a loss. Why should we bail out rich bankers!?\u201d",
            "This is basically almost every variety of take that I have seen about SVB, and it relies upon two fundamental misunderstandings of the structure of a bank.",
            "The first is that somehow depositors are always rich and/or investors in the bank. The second is that plugging the deposit hole is somehow bailing out the bankers.",
            "In this scenario, where we would end up is a slow or semi-functional resolution for the bank, in which large amounts of deposits are locked up for an indefinite period of time, and when they are released, might be worth 50-80 cents on the dollar.",
            "We can call this scenario 1.",
            "Now, let\u2019s talk about how FDIC coverage at a bank works, and how the capital stack of a bank works.",
            "Why does it work this way? I don\u2019t make the rules.",
            "If you were a person in the sense we mean, like a two-legged human being.",
            "But what if you were not? What if you were a legal person? What if that legal person is a corporation that needs to make payroll? A local grocery store chain taking payments and then paying for inventory? The donation account for a charity?",
            "There are many kinds of \u201cpersons\u201d at a bank, and most of the ones that are over FDIC limits are typically not what we mean when we say \u201cJoe is a person\u201d but rather what lawyers mean when they say \u201cSanta Clara Firefighters Pension Fund is a person\u201d.",
            "Let\u2019s also take a moment to talk about the typical capital stack of a bank. By this, I mean money that has been \u201cinvested\u201d in a bank in various ways, and as you can see, I am going to use invested pretty loosely here. These are the major components:",
            "Why did I explain all this? It will become important when we discuss fallout, which we will do now.",
            "So to talk about our capital stack above, equity is gone, bonds are gone, but deposits? Also kind of gone.",
            "In this case, you\u2019re going to have complete fucking chaos. Multiple firms likely cannot make payroll, pay vendors, or function appropriately come next week as their cash on hand is wiped out. This is less of a problem, in some ways, for companies that were hoarding cash and it was their runway (so VC-style companies) but way more of a problem for operating companies because if that was your operating capital, then\u2026?",
            "Yeah.",
            "The other problem is that SVB served as a bank for several payments and payroll processors, so all of that stuff is likely fucked beyond all recognition if there are major haircuts for anyone who was using them at scale. Again, this is not what people typically think of for banks, but it is actually the stuff more likely to break and more contagious, because what you could have is massive layoffs, disruptions, failure to pay vendors, and more for a lot of businesses in the tech space and local California space.",
            "Now let us consider the other option, which we are going to call Scenario 2, which is going to be derided in the popular press (or at least some economically illiterate quarters of it) as a bank bailout.",
            "In this case, where the \u201crich bankers\u201d are being \u201cbailed out\u201d, here is what the recoveries are going to look like: equity is wiped, bonds are wiped, but deposits are almost entirely (if not completely) safe.",
            "I want you to pause, consider what we said about capital stack before, and ask who got bailed out here. The investors? Toast. The employees and executives paid in stock for their giant bonuses? Toast. The venture capital and private equity funds that invested in the bank? Toast.",
            "You know who is not toast? The depositors who were using the bank as customers. Some of those people, yes, will be rich people and some will be angry that they were \u201cbailed out\u201d (even though in this case, it\u2019s unlikely those people were investing for a profit because you wouldn\u2019t be a depositor if that were the case!). Many more of those persons will be corporations making payroll, paying vendors, and the like. A lot of them might be things like startups, partnerships, or banking-as-a-service clients for a bank like SVB. These are not typically the things you expect to be completely wiped out, and making sure your building facilities people get paid or that the non-profit donation account doesn\u2019t get wiped out are not the \u201crich\u201d we rail against in a bailout.",
            "As a general matter, in scenario 2, contagion is very limited. Yes, there are some equity losses and a handful of unlucky people who went super big on SVB are going to end up bankrupt. Bondholders might be ticked, if there are many of them. But all of these people knew the game and this is what they signed up for. C\u2019est la vie.",
            "I think it is pretty obvious one of these outcomes is both better and fairer than the other, and yet it\u2019s the one decried for being a bailout. I hold the view that this mostly comes from a lack of understanding about how a bank is structured and the role depositors play.",
            "Now here is where things get interesting. First, I need to expose an important truth about bank runs that people gloss over completely: all banks have exposure to runs.",
            "That is to say there does not exist a type of bank that can withstand a run. The question is how much damage it will do. The other question is the network effects of the run, as a run on individual banks works very differently than a run on the entire banking system, as this is a network problem.",
            "Let us start with the simple model that I had created in a previous post:",
            "If that is our bank balance sheet, then one of the things you can see is that banks have some buffer of equity in normal cases, and then beyond that, they have deposits. If 100% of the deposits leave, you\u2026 don\u2019t have a bank? This is the definition of a bank run. In a literal, functional, basic sense, if you have mass deposit flight, you stop being a bank, because you stop having depositors.",
            "The questions that ultimately matter to the depositors are the following:",
            "Is everyone else going to take their money out?",
            "Thus, bank CEOs are often left playing a very dangerous confidence game. Many fail at it (see: SVB), but the best of them not just succeed but inspire confidence. The problem is to do this you need charisma, knowledge, to have actually managed risk well, and to be willing to take all sorts of slings, arrows, and daggers in public. Perhaps the best at this in recent history is Jamie Dimon, who led JPM through 2008. I can still hear him saying \u201cfortress balance sheet\u201d in my head, because he said it so many times he must whisper that in his sleep now.",
            "But it worked.",
            "Here is why that matters so much: if the answer to number 2 is that people think they will get screwed, they know that they would take their money out if they can, so the answer to number one also becomes \u201cwell, obviously\u201d. It is the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma. It would be better for everyone if we don\u2019t collectively run the bank, but if people start running the bank, you want to have gone first. Therefore, people go first.",
            "Once that process starts, it\u2019s over. And what determines if that starts? The public perception that the bank won\u2019t have enough money to pay out all the deposits, either because of losses on loans due to default, or losses on loans if they are a forced seller due to interest rates going up.",
            "That last point is very relevant right now.",
            "This is the problem regulators are grappling with. The profile of a troubled bank in this environment looks like the following:",
            "Underwater on a securities or loan book with long duration loans made at low rates",
            "Concentrated depositor base that could rapidly engage in flight",
            "Low NIM compared to competitors (which is a tell they don\u2019t have room to move up to retain depositors)",
            "So if you are looking for banks that would be in trouble right now, I would suggest that is the profile most similar to SVB and Silvergate. I am less concerned about the giant banks with huge deposit bases, smaller banks with low duration risk and diversified deposit bases, or specialist banks where this really isn\u2019t how they operate (see: State Street).",
            "If you are a banking regulator at this moment, the question you are asking yourself about SVB is that if it goes down, will people start withdrawing deposits from other banks? Here is where we get to the uncomfortable truth about uninsured deposits: mostly people don\u2019t think deeply about counterparty credit risk to their bank, so if you make them think about it, they basically panic.",
            "The ideal situation for a regulator is that people stay calm and don\u2019t start stampeding away from other banks, as once that starts, the logical conclusion is a US banking system where you have 10-ish huge banks, a handful of key specialists, and everyone else is a corpse. That is not great for long-term competition or short-term stability, as one might imagine.",
            "So how do you stop that from happening, and why would SVB not kick off a mass contagion event for the US banking system?",
            "First, you want to resolve the SVB situation without depositors taking a haircut. Quite bluntly, recoveries for the bondholders and equity holders are simply not a priority in this situation, but depositors are. If the FDIC, who has been working quite hard over the weekend and has run this process many times since 2008, can broker a sale where the depositors are made whole, there will be much more confidence in the system overall going forward (unless this keeps happening over, and over, and over).",
            "Second, if you can\u2019t do that, you consider seriously backstopping the depositors. Again, not the bondholders or the equity, but if you allow SVB to open on Monday with a \u201cyeah, um, so if you were a depositor, we just don\u2019t know, maybe you get your money back but also maybe not and we don\u2019t know when\u201d, people are going to do the hyper-panicked speedrun just assume it\u2019s all dead version of the thing I said above and runs are likely to start on many other banks. This is a bad situation. That\u2019s why there are rumors out there of the Fed creating a facility to stop this if it starts in other places.",
            "Third, you have to project confidence and get in front of rumors of other runs. To some extend, this is the hardest problem as you are now reliant on people from multiple agencies coordinating information and the bank executives themselves not saying dumb things. Bad outcomes here increase the reliance of solutions in the first and second point, as one can imagine.",
            "Lastly, there is something of a network effect issue here. When people \u201ctake their money out of a bank\u201d, that can mean one of three things:",
            "They send it to another bank",
            "They put it in securities or a money market fund",
            "They literally ask for cash and put it in a hole in the ground or something",
            "These all have very different implications for the system. Obviously, situation number one means your total deposits are unchanged, but the location has changed. This can lead to collapses of banks and either diversification or consolidation, depending on context. The second and third are different: now your banking system is straight up losing money and people are reducing their exposure. In those cases, things start to get systemic and failures are cascading as opposed to localized. That is the 2008 scenario that caused the government to get so scared about the system, and is the one that everyone would be wise to prevent this time around.",
            "So to put my money where my mouth is, what do I think will happen?",
            "I don\u2019t think the regulators in the United States want to risk a massive, uncontrolled tailspin. I also don\u2019t think they want to be seen as offering an unlimited bailout to people who took significant risks and then got immolated because of it. Therefore, I am going to predict a middle road solution:",
            "SVB is likely sold, probably but not certainly in parts, the depositors are going to make it out with a 100% (or very high 90s) recovery in short order, and the bondholders and equityholders are going to get completely wiped out. This would send the message that if you are a depositor, you don\u2019t have to panic and we\u2019ll take care of you, but if you are running a bank or investing in one, you\u2019d better have your act together or if the reaper comes to your door, we\u2019re not saving you.",
            "Larger measures will come later, if there are bigger failures and more political will behind it. The reality is the optics of a significant \u201cbailout\u201d (even if people misunderstand that and it\u2019s mainly the depositors) for a bank named Silicon Valley Bank (especially after the obnoxious bleating of the VC crowd on Twitter, which comes across as exceptionally tone-deaf) just aren\u2019t something most politicians will go for\u2026 but neither is kicking off a chain reaction of bank failures that infects main street in shockingly short order.",
            "So we are going to get a middle solution. Will it be enough? I actually think it might, with some important caveats that other similarly situated banks to SVB might also tank this week.",
            "Now that we\u2019ve talked about the banking angle, let\u2019s talk about what might turn out to be the more important angle: the non-bank impact. SVB was a notable bank for VCs, supporting the startup ecosystem, and back-end functions for things like payroll processing. This is actually the mechanical stuff that matters a lot more, in some ways, and why all banks of sufficient size are at least somewhat \u201csystemic\u201d despite what anyone will want to say about them.",
            "In plain English, if SVB fails in disorderly fashion, there\u2019s a lot of firms that can\u2019t make payroll, pay vendors, pay for inventory, etc. in the coming days, even if they eventually get a lot of that money back, and it will have knock-on effects to the real economy. In this specific case, probably primarily the California Bay Area economy, so that\u2019s not particularly politically favorable for SVB, but that doesn\u2019t change that people would lose jobs over this.",
            "Even if SVB is rescued, however, I expect there will be impacts. One is going to be structural changes to how deals work. Banking diversification will be a thing, and reliance on one bank for serving a whole segment is pretty transparently dumb going forward. What that means is that competition for tech banking will increase, but as SVB was at the forefront, the shape and terms may be less favorable to the tech sector in the short and medium term. The shine is off the industry, and their biggest financial hub just imploded. It\u2019s hard to take that as a short-term positive, even if a long-term shift in structure might be for the best.",
            "Still, watch for the actual mainstream business impact. That is what could cause real bleeding if there is not satisfactory resolution.",
            "Speaking of stress in the market, check this out from Coinmarketcap:",
            "As it turns out, Circle was managing reserves for the stablecoin USDC by keeping a significant amount (allegedly about $11B) in bank deposits. Going back to what people mean when they say cash, they don\u2019t literally mean cash in a vault, so Circle did this instead of getting much larger amounts of the reserve money into t-bills or other forms of securities.",
            "It was revealed Friday that Circle might have exposure to SVB, and over the weekend, it became clear they held $3.3B of reserves at SVB, according to Circle themselves. That\u2019s not great risk management about cash, but my thoughts on that are definitely too long for this blog post and I\u2019ll be creating another one on how to manage funds for a stablecoin down the road. For now, let it just be said this meant that they had $3.3B minus $250k of FDIC coverage of exposure to SVB, potentially.",
            "They also suspended withdrawals over the weekend (likely due to running out of cash at 24/7 fast payments rail banks, a traditional banking problem I have talked about before).",
            "Now, is that real? There are two questions. The first is they attempted to wire money out, and allege they made the cutoff before the FDIC put the bank into receivership. If this is true (I have no personal knowledge), then they should get the money and there is not a hole. The second is even if they didn\u2019t, are they going to recover on the deposits?",
            "Some very rough napkin math is that if you had $3.3B of exposure against low $40B of outstanding, that\u2019s ~8% of your total. So the point where USDC traded down below .92 either implies that people thought other banks were going to die and Circle would lose even more, that somehow the US treasury was going to default (the rest is in t-bills, remember), or that Circle had stolen the money and was off to the races. It\u2019s indicative of a panic. There\u2019s no fundamental reason for that. More so, if you understand recovery levels, then SVB is likely getting back at least 70% even in a very, very conservative scenario, so the actual trading level is more like 2-3% down, meaning USDC was likely a screaming buy beneath .97. Right?",
            "So one of the things to consider here is that we actually have to make some assumptions about how things are going, as there are well-founded reasons to believe that maybe USDC should be trading below .97. What are they?",
            "One is how Circle redeems. If they actually had a 3% hole, and they allow 1:1 redemptions starting on Monday, what this actually means is that the first 97% of people to redeem would get $1, but the last 3% would get $0. That is definitely not .97! Neither of those numbers are! So if you believe Circle has a hole, but also is going to carry on like they don\u2019t, and you don\u2019t currently have a Circle account or way to redeem, you might just want to get off this train.",
            "Two is that you might just have lost faith in Circle over this. One of the truisms of the stablecoin game is that people need to have confidence in the reserves and the mechanics of getting their hands on those reserves, but that\u2019s fine. However, if you break that confidence either through poor management or through being in places where people doubt they can get the money out (either through lack of rule of law or through regulatory capriciousness) then you can have long-term doubts in your viability.",
            "Three is people are actually thinking that bank run contagion will kick off and Circle\u2019s other banks are at risk. I don\u2019t want to discount this to zero and USDC would be an imperfect but plausible way to play that. I don\u2019t like that trade and wouldn\u2019t do it, but I can\u2019t say nobody is using it this way.",
            "The reality is they have most of the money, unless the US treasury nukes, in which case I don\u2019t think the stablecoin is really our biggest problem. It may take them time to process all the withdrawals, as if market makers and hedge funds were loading up on USDC over the weekend they could see a shelf of over $10B of redemptions to close the gap. It\u2019s entirely possible this will happen and Circle\u2019s business is about to get absolutely wrecked.",
            "But it\u2019s also very unlikely they don\u2019t have at least a large supermajority of the money. This is the nice part of a fully disclosed stablecoin. You know what is there. We should have more clarity this week, so stay tuned on this space.",
            "This usually doesn\u2019t turn out to be more, but assuming higher yields mean higher total returns because you ignored the risk is apparently standard practice in fixed income now? This is the kind of thing I used to lose my mind over when I ran a trading desk at JPM.",
            "At more than one past job, I have had to explain that just because a fixed yield t-note 4 years forward is higher than the 3mo t-bill, it does not mean you will earn more holding that than owning t-bills for that whole duration. No I will not name names.",
            "This is not precisely correct and is a rule of thumb, ignoring things like convexity as well, but what it means is if you have a 3-year duration bond and rates change by 1%, that bond will change in price by 3%.",
            "This is the legal definition of person, so a corporation is one \u201cperson\u201d, but a married couple is two. Don\u2019t ask me about married corporations.",
            "Sadly this doesn\u2019t mean they were old people (though they might be!); it means that in a bankruptcy they collect recovery value before the equity holders do.",
            "And if you haven\u2019t and you got this far in this piece, I\u2019m genuinely impressed.",
            "Legal persons, not 2-legged persons",
            "Specifically those over FDIC limits",
